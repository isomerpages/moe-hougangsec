<h3>School Song</h3>
<p>We sing our song with joy and pride
<br>To tell the world we do things right
<br>Search ourselves to be true
<br>Uphold the creed Hougeans learn in school</p>
<p>We learn the skills with grit and zeal
<br>To stand the tests both tough and real
<br>Urge ourselves to excel
<br>Prepare for the future that none can tell</p>
<p>Chorus:
<br>Respect ourselves, respect others
<br>Thus, we develop noble characters
<br>Work together for Singapore
<br>Make the difference on any shore</p>

quiz, and unleashed their creativity at Makers' Garage with personalised
tote bags and cups.</p>
