#### Chingay Parade Volunteers

<img src="/images/cpv1.jpeg" style="width:55%">


We would first like to thank Hougang Secondary School for being supportive of the students volunteering for Chingay Parade 2017.

  

We are really grateful to have gotten the consistent support of the school for the past few years to allow the students to join us in this massive project and making it a successful one.

  

Secondly, we would like to thank the student volunteers who were involved.

  

All the student volunteers were committed, enthusiastic, stood strong in their respective roles and gave their best to provide the best experience for the audience.

  

With the support of different cohorts of students every year, we do hope that each batch of them learned something out from this volunteering journey, be it learning experience, making new friends or even a small gesture of help to any fellow volunteer or audience. We hope it had been a fruitful and memorable experience for them.

  

Do express our sincere thanks to this batch of students and share with them that they had all done a brilliant job during the 2 parade days.

  

Lastly, we would like to thank the teachers' assistance, time and effort spent on liaising and bringing the students down to the venue for the various event dates. We really appreciate the effort to ensure the safety and welfare of the students.

  
Once again, thank you!  
  
Best regards,

#### One Dream Journal

One Dream Journal Launch at HS on 30 January

  

The Dream Journal is a collaborative project conceived by The One Dream Initiative and motion, supportedby the SG50 Celebration Fund. The journals’ purpose is for Singaporeans, especially the youth to write, and draw their dreams, hopes, aspirations and ambitions. The team behind this Dream Journal, seeks to broaden dreams and inspire a deepening connection towards society.

  

The Dream Journal contains black and white images of students from Hougang Secondary School, shot by Alecia Neo (an independent photographer and visual artist). The creative team from Motion designed and carefully selected inspirational quotes from well-known thinkers and history makers alike and superimposed these quotes, on images of students and Singapore city skyline.

  

The Dream Journal will be distributed to all secondary schools, ITEs in Singapore. Indeed, HS is honoured to be part of this project.

  

“Borne out of One Dream’s raison d’être that everyone should have a Dream --- a Dream which connects Self &amp; Society, that as one gets more successful in life, to also help others fulfill their dreams. In a very simple way should all citizens and residents think and behave this way, Singapore and the world will be a much better, much brighter place.”

\- Peter Ong, Leader, One Dream Initiative.
