Greetings!

HS places strong emphasis on character and values education. It is committed to nurture every Hougean to be Passionate Learners, Principled Leaders and Grateful Citizens, who will make the difference in their life journey even after they leave the gates of HS. There are opportunities for Hougeans to be imbued with the school’s core values of GRIT (Gratitude, Respect, Ingenuity, Trustworthiness and Grit) through its Instructional, Character and Citizenship Education, Student Leadership, CCAs, Learning for Life and Applied Learning programmes which cater to different needs and interests of the students.

  

We believe that sound values are the bedrock for development of character. Therefore, our Learning for Life Programme – Community Youth Leadership, "Make the Difference, A Hougean’s Way of Life", provides a sustained and enhanced values education progressively over 4/5 years. Leveraging on the Service-Learning approach, students take ownership of their involvement in VIA projects, seek to understand the needs of the community, and co-construct and mentor their peers to bring about awareness, action and advocacy in their chosen area of community need.

  

To nurture Hougeans to be confident and competent speakers, our Applied Learning Programme, "Effective Communication Skills through Authentic Learning" strives to promote communication skills using real life learning platforms. By furnishing students with authentic settings and problems, they will be able to acquire useful and transferable communication skills. The programme includes broadcasting, public speaking, debates, drama and journalism.

  

In line with MOE’s direction of promoting Joy of Learning, we have reduced the assessment demands on students by removing the mid-year examination for Sec 1 and 3. Instead, we have included other formative and alternative assessments like projects, presentations and various performance tasks, all of which are designed for deeper learning and understanding.

  

This year, we are celebrating our 20th Anniversary. We are very grateful to Mr Chia Choon Kiat, our founding Principal, for formulating the school’s mission - Care, Lead, Inspire and Partner. Mr Ng Tiong Nam, our second Principal, set it into the hearts and minds of the teachers and students through his strong leadership. The commitment and dedication of the staff have allowed the school to, in the short span of 20 years, to make its mark, especially in the area of Values-in-Action.

  

In the past 20 years, one thing has remained unchanged – the fond memories that our students have of HS, be it of the friends they have made or the teachers who have, in one way or another, influenced their lives. The school will continue to work closely with her stakeholders, especially the alumni and parents, in providing a holistic education for all Hougeans imbuing in them the school’s GRIT values.

Best wishes for 2020!


Yours sincerely,   
Mr Ari Manickam    
Principal
