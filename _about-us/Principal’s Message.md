A warm welcome to Hougang Secondary School! 

Over the holidays, I was invited to an event organised by the Alumni. I experienced the strong camaraderie and pride from the Alumni as they hosted the graduating classes of 2016 to open the time capsules they had curated. The alumni shared with me that their younger siblings also enrolled in Hougang Secondary because they wanted to go through the same positive learning experience and grow as passionate learners, principled leaders and grateful citizens. This could only be possible with the strong leadership of my predecessors, Mr. Arivazhagan Manickam, Mr. Ng Tiong Nam and Mr. Chia Choon Kiat working with the committed staff in Hougang Secondary. I am indeed privileged to be a new member of the Hougang Secondary family.

In 2023, we will continue to build upon the strong foundation laid. With the nation emerging from the COVID-19 and the loosening of restrictions, we are in a good position to deepen the learning experiences of our students. Hougeans are keen and want to learn. In line with our school philosophy, we acknowledge their uniqueness and strive to develop them according to their abilities through a high-quality educational experience in Hougang Secondary. The focus is not solely on academic results, we will continue to place strong emphasis on the character development of Hougeans. They will have more opportunities to contribute as community youth leaders who will make the positive difference in the lives of others, guided by the values of gratitude, respect, ingenuity, trustworthiness and grit.

It is increasingly important to equip students with thinking tools that they can use as an approach to solving problems, including problems that have not existed before. To prepare Hougeans for the future, we will continue to create opportunities for our students to develop a problem-solving mindset. We will enhance our signature Innovation Cohort Programme which has been adapted from Design Thinking. Through the approach of Feel, Imagine, Do and Share (FIDS), our students will feel and empathise with the people they are designing the solutions for. They will think out of the box and imagine innovative solutions which may not yet exist. Where possible, our students will turn concept into reality and implement the solutions to challenges identified. They will also share their learning with the school community so that we continue to build our collective knowledge to innovate. Hougang Secondary is committed to deepening our innovative core so that Hougeans will be future ready after journeying with us for 4 to 5 years. 

We can achieve these through partnering with parents and other stakeholders to care, lead as well as inspire our students. I look forward to engaging with all of you in the coming years.
