<p><strong>Principal’s Message 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Hougang Secondary School!</p>
<p>As we embark on a new year, I am filled with hope and excitement for the
journey that lies ahead. To our new Secondary 1 students joining the family,
a very warm welcome! You are beginning an exciting chapter of your life,
and we are here to support you every step of the way. At Hougang Secondary
School, you are valued and appreciated, and we believe in your worth and
potential. Let this be a place where you discover your strengths, cultivate
a growth mindset, and embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and
learning. Together, we will nurture your abilities and help you realise
your aspirations, as we have been doing for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>This year marks the launch of our new Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
in STEM, titled “<strong>HS Innovates, For Life!</strong>”. The ALP is
designed to equip our students with the 21st-century competencies essential
for success in a rapidly changing world. Through engaging hands-on projects
and activities, we will explore challenges brought about by urbanisation
and real-world issues, empowering our students with innovative, adaptive
thinking, design thinking skills, and technological literacy. These experiences
aim to inspire a spirit of curiosity and problem-solving, preparing our
students to thrive in a dynamic global landscape.</p>
<p>I am heartened and grateful for the achievements and progress of Hougang
Secondary School in 2024. Our students achieved the best results yet in
the national examinations, a testament to their hard work, resilience,
and the dedication of our educators. We remain committed to strengthening
teaching and learning experiences to help every Hougean realise their fullest
potential. This commitment reflects our belief that every student can achieve
excellence with the right support and opportunities.</p>
<p>I am also immensely proud of our staff, whose dedication and excellence
have been recognised nationally. In 2024, they have been honoured with
National Day Awards, recognition as Finalist of the President’s Award for
Teachers, awards from the Academy of Singapore Teachers, the MOE Innergy
Awards, and the MOE Outstanding Innovator Award. These accolades are a
testament to the quality of staff at Hougang Secondary School and their
unwavering commitment to nurturing future-ready Hougeans.</p>
<p>In 2025, we celebrate a significant milestone: Hougang Secondary School’s
25th Anniversary. The celebration, centred on the value of gratitude, invites
us to reflect on our journey and celebrate the people who have made this
school a place of inspiration and growth. As part of this celebration,
we look forward to reconnecting with our alumni and honouring the legacy
of educators who laid the strong foundation. We will come together to cherish
our past, celebrate the present, and look forward to an even brighter future.</p>
<p>As we journey through this milestone year, we remain steadfast in our
vision of <strong>Nurturing Empowered, Future-Ready Hougeans of Character and Purpose</strong>.
Our school values—<strong>Gratitude, Respect, Empathy, Adaptability, and Trustworthiness</strong>—will
continue to guide us as we strive for excellence in all that we do.</p>
<p>2025 will continue to be a year of hope, growth, and achievement for every
member of our Hougang Secondary family!</p>
<p>Mr. Brandon Lee</p>
<p>Principal</p>
