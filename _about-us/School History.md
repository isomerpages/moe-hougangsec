Hougang Secondary School (HS) was established in 2001 as a Government co-educational school at Lowland Road. On 20 December 2001, the school relocated to its current site at Hougang Street 93. The spacious and conducive physical environment as well as the up-to-date facilities offer opportunities for all Hougeans to strive for excellence and 'Make the Difference'. HS provides a holistic and quality education for Hougeans to pursue their strengths and passions. Premised on this belief, the school partners parents and stakeholders to care, lead and inspire students to discover their passion and fulfil their aspirations.

HS places strong emphasis on character and values education. It is committed to nurture every Hougean into Passionate Learners, Principled Leaders and Grateful Citizens, who will make the difference in their life journey even after they have left the gates of HS. There are opportunities for Hougeans to be imbued with the school’s core values of GRIT (Gratitude, Respect, Ingenuity, Trustworthiness and Grit) through its Instructional, Character and Citizenship Education, Student Leadership, CCAs, Learning for Life and Applied Learning programmes which cater to different needs and interests of the students. The school also believes in building strength of character and inculcating values such as “Respect Yourself, Respect Others” and “Choose Wisely, Face Consequences Squarely” which serve to guide our students in their pursuit of skills and knowledge.

HS believes that strong values will provide students the impetus towards academic excellence. Therefore, the school's Learning for Life Programme – Community Youth Leadership, "Values in Action, A Hougean Way of Life", provides a sustained and enhanced values education progressively over 4/5 years. Leveraging on the Service Learning approach, students take ownership of their involvement in VIA projects, seek to understand the needs of the community, and co-construct and mentor their peers to bring about awareness, action and advocacy in their chosen area of community need.

To nurture Hougeans to be confident and competent speakers, the school’s Applied Learning Programme, "Effective Communication Skills through Authentic Learning" strives to promote communication skills using real life learning platforms. By furnishing students with authentic settings and problems, they will be able to acquire useful and transferable communication skills. The programme includes broadcasting, public speaking, debates, drama and journalism.

A school of distinction, HS was recognised for having best practices in Student All-Round Development, Character and Citizenship Education, and Teaching & Learning in 2016.
