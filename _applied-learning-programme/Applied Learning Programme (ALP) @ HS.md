With the aim of Promoting Communication Skills using Authentic Learning as a Platform, HS Applied Learning Programme has three student learning outcomes:

1\. Infusing communication skills into the language (English Language and Mother Tongue Languages) curriculum

2\. Gaining communication skills in both languages (EL and MTL) via various workshops, to boost their confidence and competencies in connecting with the real world

3\. Being given opportunities to lead during assemblies, performances and student-initiated activities to maximise the authentic learning experience.

All students undergo a 3-year Applied Learning Programme, focussed on developing the following skills at each level:
