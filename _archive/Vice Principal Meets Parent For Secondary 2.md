<p>Does the school offer triple science for the Express course?</p>

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The school offers 7-subject combinations to our Secondary 3 Express students.
Triple science (i.e. Pure Physics, Pure Chemistry and Pure Biology) is
not one of the options offered as it is not a prerequisite for courses
at Institutions of Higher Learning.</p>
<p>For e.g., to do Medicine in NUS (Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine) / NTU
(Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine), a student is only required to have
a good H2 pass in Chemistry and a good H2 pass in either Biology or Physics
at A-level. This means that students need to do well in Chemistry and either
Biology or Physics at O-Level to continue to pursue these subjects at A-level.
Do refer to the Junior College and University websites for more information
on the subject prerequisites.</p>

<p>Will there be any Home-based Learning (HBL) this year?</p>

<p>School Leaders/Mr Javen Gwee/Mr Charles Wong</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Yes, Home-Based Learning (HBL) continues to be relevant and important
to our students. The information has been shared with parents via the Term
1 Parents Connect. It can also be found on the school website. Parents
can access the link : <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.hougangsec.moe.edu.sg/quick-links/HBL-SIL/hbl-sil/</a> for

<p>Why is there still a need for HBL in 2024? Most students are unable to
focus well at home.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>School Leaders/Mr Javen Gwee/Mr Charles Wong</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) serves to strengthen our students’ ability to
be self-directed learners who are capable of taking greater ownership of
their learning. In continuing with HBL, we equip our students with the
necessary skills, dispositions and habits for independent and lifelong
learning.</p>

<p>For SIL, how should we advise our children on what to focus on for their
SIL? Should we just advise them to pursue their passion and interest?</p>

<p>Mdm Lim CL</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Students are encouraged to select an area that they are interested in
because we believe they are more motivated to do their SIL project if it
is something that they are keen on. Parents can support your children by
discussing their areas of interest and passion with them.</p>

<p>My boy is interested in Body Building. Can 1 hour of SIL be used for exercise

<p>Mdm Lim CL</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Students are free to explore and select any area that they are keen to
do their SIL project. However, the safety aspects of their SIL plan must
be cleared by their Character Coaches and their parents’ approval must
be sought before they can proceed to work on their plans. For this case,
as part of the safety measures, the student can approach his PE teachers
for advice on his intended workout. Other than the workout in the gym,
the student is expected to write out his plan in the beginning and his
reflection at the end of his SIL journey.</p>

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>For lateral transfer (e.g., from Normal Academic to Express), a student
needs to first meet the promotion criteria, and obtain 70% or higher in
the average of all subjects. Thereafter, the school will work with the
parents in making an informed decision in the best interest of the student.
This includes assessing the student’s learning dispositions and motivation
in consultation with the teachers.</p>
