<h1>CCA</h1>
<p>At Hougang Secondary School, we believe in providing our students with
a holistic education, where Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) play a vital
role in shaping their secondary school experience. In an increasingly complex
world, CCAs are essential in equipping students with life skills, values,
and social-emotional competencies. They offer students meaningful opportunities
to explore new interests, deepen existing skills, and grow in character.
CCAs also serve as a shared space where students from diverse backgrounds
build friendships and develop together over their 4 to 5 years in Hougang
Secondary School.</p>
