<p><strong><u>LEAPS 2.0</u></strong>
</p>
<p><u>Recognition of Secondary School Students’ attainment and learning in Co-Curriculum</u>
</p>
<p>To provide students with a holistic and well-rounded experience in the
co-curriculum, the Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced the LEAPS 2.0
framework in secondary schools. LEAPS 2.0 has 4 domains as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Participation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achievement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework serves to recognise a secondary school students’ holistic
development. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in the
four domains.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong>: This domain recognises the student’s participation
in school-based Co-curricular Activities for the development of specific
knowledge and skills, be it in Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups (UG) or
Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) CCA. Sustained engagement over four to
five years in a chosen CCA allows for the progressive development of skills
and knowledge, character development, forging of friendships and building
of team spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Achievement</strong>: This domain recognises the different levels
of representation and accomplishment in the student’s involvement in school
or other external organisations. Representing the school or external organisations
in competitions, festivals or their equivalent provides the platform for
students to actualise and showcase their talent as well as benchmark their
level of mastery. The opportunity to go through the learning process, be
disciplined and rigorous in preparation, and strive for excellence presents
valuable learning experiences for the student. Accomplishments (e.g. winning
medals, accolades and awards) at these school-endorsed platforms are also
recognised.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong>: This domain recognises the development of
the student’s leadership dispositions - as an individual who can lead himself/herself,
work with others in a team and grow as a leader to become a confident person.
It recognises a plethora of school leadership learning opportunities, ranging
from participation in student leadership programmes, to leading projects,
to formal leadership appointments within CCA or school-wide.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong>: This domain recognises the student’s development
as an individual who is socially responsible and understands his/her role
in contributing to the well-being of others. Participation in Values in
Action (VIA) such as service-learning encourages the student to take ownership
and identify the community issues they are concerned about, and initiate
action among peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others.</p>
<p><strong><u>Recognition of Students’ Co-curricular Attainment</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment
will be recognised with Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment will
be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior
Colleges/Centralised Institute/Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical Education
(JCs/CI/Poly/ITE).</p>
