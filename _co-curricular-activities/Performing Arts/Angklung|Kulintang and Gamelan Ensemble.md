<p><strong>Celebrating a Year of Music and Milestones:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>HS Angklung Kulintang &amp; Gamelan Ensemble's Memorable 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>The year 2024 has been a truly remarkable one for the Angklung Kulintang
&amp; Gamelan Ensemble, as we were involved in several prestigious events
that showcased the rich cultural heritage of our music and brought us closer
to the community. From school celebrations to national performances, our
ensemble has had the honor of representing our school in ways that will
leave lasting memories.</p>
<p>Our musical journey began with performances at significant school events
such as Chinese New Year, Speech Day, and National Day. These occasions
allowed us to share the beauty of our traditional instruments, delighting
both students and staff with our lively and vibrant rendition.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable highlights of the year was when we were invited
to perform at the Istana for the inaugural Hari Raya Aidilfitri cum Labour
Day celebration. It was an extraordinary experience to perform in front
of distinguished guests, including Singapore’s President, Mr. Tharman Shanmugaratnam,
and his wife. The ensemble members not only enjoyed showcasing their musical
talents, but also had the unique opportunity to interact with the President
and other guests of honor, making it an unforgettable moment in our musical
journey.</p>
<p>As the year progressed, our ensemble continued to represent the school
with pride. In another significant achievement, we were invited to perform
at a cluster board meeting hosted by Hougang Secondary School. This event,
which brought together school leaders from various institutions, was a
fitting conclusion to an eventful year. Our performance was well-received
and highlighted the importance of fostering cultural appreciation within
our community.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the year, 2024 has undoubtedly been one of growth, pride,
and accomplishment for every member of the Angklung Kulintang &amp; Gamelan
Ensemble. As we close out this exciting chapter, we are eagerly looking
ahead to the challenges and opportunities that await us in 2025, especially
with the upcoming Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) competition.</p>
