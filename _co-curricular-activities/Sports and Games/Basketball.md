Basketball is a team sport that requires everyone to be a good team player. The importance of teamwork and discipline is highly emphasised during all trainings and activities.&nbsp;

  

The team is committed to apply the lessons learnt on the court to their daily lives as well – to bring their fighting spirit to their studies and to pursue excellence in life. With basketball as a platform, students learn how to work effectively as a team, develop sportsmanship and resilience, experience the tangible success of hard work and discipline – and of course, build their physical and mental strength. &nbsp;  
  
While the physical and skill trainings are important, the team also values working together to serve the community. Through the various VIA programmes, the students get to not only apply the values and skills learnt, but in a meaningful and purposeful way.
