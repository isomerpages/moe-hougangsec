<h3>Our experiences in Netball:</h3>
<p><strong>Chloe (3U)</strong>
<br>My experience in netball was amazing, I get to know people who also have
the same interest as me. The challenges I faced in netball was my stamina
because to last throughout the game, I overcame them by exercising at home
such as lifting weights. Because of netball I became fitter than before.
The most memorable event in netball cca is the carnivals where I got to
bond well with my teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Jerrine (3G)</strong>
<br>When I first joined netball , it was exhausting but very exciting for
me. I learned how to shoot a goal as a goal shooter, it wasn't easy but
I managed by practising shooting the ball to the goal. Challenges that
I faced are having a hard time building up teamwork with teammates and
mastering up to new skills. I overcome my challenges by spending time with
my teammates and participate in bonding activities. The best memories I
had in netball is winning sportsmanship during NSG with flying colors and
i also enjoy the carnivals with my teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah (2E)</strong>
<br>When I first joined netball , it was really fun but also intense. The
challenges I faced are teamwork and communication. I overcome them by getting
to know their characteristics and understand more of how they feel in netball.
I also get to know them better by team bonding games.</p>
