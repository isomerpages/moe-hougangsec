### Our experiences in Netball:
**Chloe (3U)**   
My experience in netball was amazing, I get to know people who also have the same interest as me. The challenges I faced in netball was my stamina because to last throughout the game, I overcame them by exercising at home such as lifting weights. Because of netball I became fitter than before. The most memorable event in netball cca is the carnivals where I got to bond well with my teammates.

**Jerrine (3G)**  
When I first joined netball , it was exhausting but very exciting for me. I learned how to shoot a goal as a goal shooter, it wasn't easy but I managed by practising shooting the ball to the goal. Challenges that I faced are having a hard time building up teamwork with teammates and mastering up to new skills. I overcome my challenges by spending time with my teammates and participate in bonding activities. The best memories I had in netball is winning sportsmanship during NSG with flying colors and i also enjoy the carnivals with my teammates.

**Sarah (2E)**  
 When I first joined netball , it was really fun but also intense. The challenges I faced are teamwork and communication. I overcome them by getting to know their characteristics and understand more of how they feel in netball. I also get to know them better by team bonding games.
