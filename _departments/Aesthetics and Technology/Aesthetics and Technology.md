### Collaborative Project 
**Secondary 3 A&T Staff Day Project**  
This is a collaborative project that involves three units - Art, Design & Technology (D&T), and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) - within the A&T department, and it includes G1 students. The objective of the project is for the students to express their appreciation to the teaching and non-teaching staff at HS.

Authentic project provides the desired authentic learning experiences and a glimpse of the work habits and skills of the food industry with the provision of exposure to the food industry (SEAB, 2015). It includes authentic design opportunities that are meaningful and trains them to display designerly dispositions (MOE, 2016). It incorporates the practices by artists and designers that enlighten students of their further learning and career opportunities (MOE, 2018). These statements echo the description of AA whereby students exhibit knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed in professional life (Gulikers et al., 2004).

The students were given specific assignments for the project, including designing department logos using Canva for Art, constructing dessert table structures for D&T, and planning, baking, and packaging biscuits into bottles for NFS.

Students applied the skills taught in their lessons to design and prepare their task/products with the guidance of their subject teachers. The authentic learning experience also encourage students to trouble shoot on the problems faced during the whole process. Equipped with the skills taught during curriculum, students were given the ownership to plan, prepare and design their products.
