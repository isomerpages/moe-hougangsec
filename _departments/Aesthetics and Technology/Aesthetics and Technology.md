<h3>Department Vision</h3>
<p><strong>To nurture creative and confident thinkers</strong>
</p>
<p>The Aesthetics &amp; Technology department comprises of four subjects
- Design &amp; Technology, Nutrition and Food Science, Visual Arts and
Music.</p>
<p>Our dedicated staff team aims to nurture our students to become confident
thinkers with deep appreciation of design, aesthetics and food technology.
Our curriculum is thoughtfully designed and is coursework-based, providing
experiential learning to all students.</p>
<p>Our students are also given multiple opportunities to experience real-life
learning through participation in enrichment and competitions to enhance
their holistic education.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 &amp; 2 FCE Innovation Projects<br>Secondary 3 NFS Enrichment Programmes such as “Cookyn with Carbs” &amp; “Food Presentation Workshop”<br>Secondary 1 &amp; 2 Lower Secondary Music Programme<br>Secondary Art Enrichment Programme<br>Secondary 3 Design &amp; Technology ICT Lessons<br>Secondary 3 A&amp;T Staff Day Project</strong>
</p>
<h3>Collaborative Project</h3>
<p><strong>Secondary 3 A&amp;T Staff Day Project</strong>
<br>This is a collaborative project that involves three units - Art, Design
&amp; Technology (D&amp;T), and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) - within
the A&amp;T department, and it includes G1 students. The objective of the
project is for the students to express their appreciation to the teaching
and non-teaching staff at HS.</p>
<p>Authentic project provides the desired authentic learning experiences
and a glimpse of the work habits and skills of the food industry with the
provision of exposure to the food industry (SEAB, 2015). It includes authentic
design opportunities that are meaningful and trains them to display designerly
dispositions (MOE, 2016). It incorporates the practices by artists and
designers that enlighten students of their further learning and career
opportunities (MOE, 2018). These statements echo the description of AA
whereby students exhibit knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed in professional
life (Gulikers et al., 2004).</p>

<p>The students were given specific assignments for the project, including
designing department logos using Canva for Art, constructing dessert table
structures for D&amp;T, and planning, baking, and packaging biscuits into
bottles for NFS.</p>
<p>Students applied the skills taught in their lessons to design and prepare
their task/products with the guidance of their subject teachers. The authentic
learning experience also encourage students to trouble shoot on the problems
faced during the whole process. Equipped with the skills taught during
curriculum, students were given the ownership to plan, prepare and design
their products.</p>
