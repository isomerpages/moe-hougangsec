**<u>D&T CURRICULUM</u>**    
Design & Technology (D&T) emphasises thinking through sketching to generate and develop design solutions, exploration and experimentation of ideas through cognitive and hands-on endeavour of making (mock-ups and prototypes) so as to seek practical and appropriate design solutions for a situation taking into account user needs.

D&T education in Hougang Secondary aims to nurture in our students a designerly dispositions which are inherent in design practices – through designing and making. The designerly dispositions would allow them to:

*   embrace uncertainties and complexities
*   be cognizant of and resolve real-world, ill-defined problems
*   relentless drive to seek out how things work
*   use of doodling and sketching, and 3D manipulation of resistant materials as a language for visualisation, communication and presentation

**<u>ENRICHMENTS</u>**

**Ignite Challenges**   
The D&T students participates in IgnITE challenge at ITE. Organised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), the IgnITE Skills Challenge is an annual competition that presents students to technical abilities and nurtures a deeper appreciation of courses offered by ITE. Challenges are intended to be appealing and fun, for the joy of learning.

Daedalus Challenge    
*   Create a Glider using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Software
*   Develop skills in using CAD software to design and assemble an aerodynamic glider that can clear obstacles. 

**Ignite Challenge – Dream Glider**

In semester 1, the D&T students participated in the Flying Saucer IgnITE challenge at ITE central.

The objective of this program is to allow our students to work with electronics components and interpret circuit diagrams. Students also gained hands-on experience in taking electrical measurements.

A total of 12 students in 4 teams participated in the Challenge. They constructed a circuit based on the given circuit diagram. The task also required the participants to demonstrate the operation of the circuit, taking measurement and recording of the voltages of electronic components.

At the final event, teams competed in the launching and landing of their ‘Flying Saucers’ accurately. The teams with the best scores will qualify for the finals. The teams were scored according to their

1.  Speed of assembly
2.  Circuit functionality
3.  Accuracy of measurements
4.  Landing accuracy


Skill Level 1: Identify the electronics components and their functions   
Skill Level 2: Interpret circuit diagram   
Skill Level 3: Connect an electronics circuit with blinking LED and motor.

**SciTecHuMatics 2019 – Environmental Awareness**

SciTecHuMAtics is a programme designed to engage pupils through inter-disciplinary student-centered activities and to provide an opportunity for students to explore the inter-connectedness of disciplines with respect to environmental issues (e.g. recycling, water resources, etc.). For the D&T station, students used recycled water bottles as well as other scrap materials to create a plastic bottle planter made from recycled materials.
