**Lower Secondary Music Programme**    
The Lower Secondary Music Programme in Hougang Secondary School aims to:
*   Nurture the joy of music learning and making through the Experience-Concept-Application (ECA) pedagogical approach
*   Inculcate the values of grit, respect, ingenuity, trustworthiness and teamwork through collaborative and self-directed learning
*   Deepen their appreciation for music through the process of active listening, responding to music and also performing and creating music
*   Further engage students in the analyzing and evaluating of musical works and performances through multimedia modes

Through the different modes of learning, students will be equipped with the necessary musical skills and knowledge of instrumental playing (piano keyboard and guitar), technological skills in song arrangements and songwriting.

They will be assessed through various modes of formative and summative assessments such as worksheets, reflections, group work and performances.


**Upcoming Competitions**   
As students progress to the songwriting programme in Secondary 2, their chosen works will be sent for the annual SYF Songwriting Competition (2020).
