Here in HS, the students are encouraged to explore into the world of Food Sciences and out of the typical classroom experience through our enrichment and innovation programme.

**Secondary 3 Food &amp; Nutrition Enrichment Programme “Cookyn with Carbs”**
  
An enrichment programme was planned for the Secondary 3 students in September for an ‘out of the classroom’ experience. The theme chosen was on carbohydrates where students were actively engaged in making their own fresh pasta and salted egg sauce. Accompanying this dish, they also made breaded chicken thigh. They also learnt to plate their cooked dishes. It was an enriching experience for the students.

  

**Students reflections**

_“It was an interesting experience as we do not get to do this every day in the class!”_

_“The lesson in this enrichment course not only reinforces the teaching I got from my teacher, but also allows me to explore further in the world of food sciences”_

### Secondary 2 Innovation Project

Secondary 1 &amp; 2 FCE innovation project
We believe in providing our students with innovative and engaging learning opportunities that go beyond traditional classroom instruction. Our lower secondary students had the chance to participate in a project that allowed them to explore the world of nutrition and apply their learning in a practical way.

  

  

### SINO-SG Exchange

  

HS hosted a 3-day school visit with Haikou No 1. Middle school and as part of their learning in HS, our FCE Unit was delighted to share a hands-on Food Culture lesson with them. The students created the dish “Roti Jala” and tasted the dish with chicken curry. They also learnt the diverse culture and races in Singapore.
