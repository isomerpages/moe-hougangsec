Here in HS, the students are encouraged to explore into the world of Food Sciences and out of the typical classroom experience through our enrichment and innovation programme.

### Secondary 3 NFS Enrichment Programmes

**Enrichment Programme “Cookyn with Carbs”**
  
An enrichment programme was planned for the Secondary 3 students in September for an ‘out of the classroom’ experience. The theme chosen was on carbohydrates where students were actively engaged in making their own fresh pasta and salted egg sauce. Accompanying this dish, they also made breaded chicken thigh. They also learnt to plate their cooked dishes. It was an enriching experience for the students.



  

**Students reflections**

_“It was an interesting experience as we do not get to do this every day in the class!”_

_“The lesson in this enrichment course not only reinforces the teaching I got from my teacher, but also allows me to explore further in the world of food sciences”_

### Secondary 1 &amp; 2 Innovation Project  

We believe in providing our students with innovative and engaging learning opportunities that go beyond traditional classroom instruction. Our lower secondary students had the chance to participate in a project that allowed them to explore the world of nutrition and apply their learning in a practical way.

Through a series of tasks, students were tasked with researching the nutritional needs of different age groups, including young children, school-going children, teenagers, young adults, and the elderly. Using the design thinking framework, students learned about the factors to consider when planning meals for each target group, such as dietary restrictions, portion sizes, and food preferences.

Once they had a solid understanding of the nutritional needs of their assigned target group, students were paired and grouped together to prepare, cook, and serve a healthy and interesting one-dish meal that was suitable for their target group. This allowed students to put their knowledge into action and develop important practical skills such as meal planning, food preparation, and cooking techniques.

After completing their dishes, students shared their products with the class and explained why their chosen dish was suitable for their assigned target group. This not only allowed students to showcase their culinary skills but also enabled them to practice public speaking and communication skills.

Overall, this project provided our students with a hands-on learning experience that allowed them to develop important skills while also learning about the importance of nutrition and healthy eating habits. 

It is a privilege to witness the growth and development of our students as they engage in meaningful learning experiences.  We look forward to providing more innovative learning opportunities in the future.


### SINO-SG Exchange

  

HS hosted a 3-day school visit with Haikou No 1. Middle school and as part of their learning in HS, our FCE Unit was delighted to share a hands-on Food Culture lesson with them. The students created the dish “Roti Jala” and tasted the dish with chicken curry. They also learnt the diverse culture and races in Singapore.
