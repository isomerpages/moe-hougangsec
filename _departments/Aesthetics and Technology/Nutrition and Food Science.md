Here in HS, the students are encouraged to explore into the world of Food Sciences and out of the typical classroom experience through our enrichment and innovation programme.

###  Nurturing Future-Ready Learners

At Hougang Secondary School (HS), we believe in igniting the joy of learning by designing lessons that spark curiosity, passion, and motivation. Every learning experience is thoughtfully crafted to deepen students’ understanding of nutrition, promote healthy living, and cultivate innovative thinking. Through this approach, we empower students to make informed decisions and develop lifelong learning habits that support their well-being and future readiness.

### NutriQuench Challenge 2024

Students at Hougang Secondary School (HS) deepen their understanding of nutrition and healthy living through authentic, real-world learning experiences. One such opportunity is the NutriQuench Challenge, organised by Pokka and Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP).

The NutriQuench Challenge 2024 tasked participants with creating a healthy, refreshing, and innovative beverage that aligns with current health trends and consumer needs. Students were required to develop lower-sugar tea beverages that meet Nutri-Grade A or B standards — a meaningful way to apply their Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS) knowledge.

Our HS NFS team demonstrated creativity, resilience, and strong scientific understanding as they progressed through two phases of the competition, refining their recipe and enhancing their presentation before the final showcase.

Their final creation — the Mango Osmanthus Drink — stood out for its flavour profile, originality, and health-conscious formulation. The team impressed the judges and clinched **First Prize** in the competition.

Congratulations to our students for their outstanding achievement and for exemplifying the spirit of innovation, healthy living, and applied learning!



### Junior Chef Culinary Competition 2025 
  
Our Secondary 3 students also participated in the Junior Chef Culinary Competition, organised in collaboration with Republic Polytechnic (RP). Two teams from Hougang Secondary made it to the finals with their creative and flavour-packed dishes — the Rojak Burger and the Sambal Stingray Burger.

The finals featured a live “cook-off” held at RP’s training kitchen, where participants demonstrated their culinary skills, creativity, and teamwork under authentic competition conditions.

We are proud to share that our Rojak Burger emerged as the 1st Prize Winner of the competition.

Congratulations to our talented young chefs for their remarkable achievement and for showcasing their passion, innovation, and culinary excellence!

### Ignite BreadCycle Challenge 2025  
At Hougang Secondary School, we make learning exciting by designing lessons that spark curiosity and help students discover their passions. This was seen in our students’ recent success at the 2025 IgnITE Skills Challenge, a national competition organised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).

Our team won 1st place in the BreadCycle Challenge: Innovate and Repurpose category, where they had to turn day-old bread into new and useful products. They created skincare items like face masks and scrubs using upcycled breadcrumbs and lemon peel powder, applying what they learned in class to solve real-world problems.

Their project caught national attention — they were featured in The Straits Times and interviewed on 91.3FM, where they shared their challenges and dreams.
This experience gave them valuable skills, boosted their confidence, and showed how creativity and sustainability can go hand in hand.

### Celebrating Community, Sustainability &amp; Innovation at Hougang Secondary School
As part of Hougang Secondary School’s 25th Anniversary celebrations, our NFS teachers and Secondary 3 students prepared a delightful range of desserts to commemorate Teachers’ Day and give back to the school community. Their heartfelt effort not only showcased their culinary skills but also reflected the spirit of gratitude and appreciation that defines our HS culture.

During the school’s carnival programme, the NFS department collaborated with the ALP Unit to prepare desserts and distribute freshly harvested vegetables from our Hydroponics Garden. Students, staff, and PSG members enjoyed these homegrown greens while learning more about sustainable eating and the benefits of urban farming.

### Youth Festival - Growing and Glowing Sustainably
Our commitment to contributing to the wider community continued through the Youth Festival, where Hougang Secondary partnered with the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) Unit to engage residents from Ang Mo Kio GRC, Jalan Kayu, Kebun Baru, and Yio Chu Kang SMCs.

Under the theme “Grow Up Sustainably,” students showcased vegetables grown in our Autopots and Hydroponics Garden. Festival visitors created their own DIY customised salad kits to take home, raising awareness of urban farming and encouraging healthy, sustainable eating habits.

At the “Glow Up Sustainably” workshop, winners of the IgnITE BreadCycle Challenge guided participants in crafting eco-friendly face masks using upcycled breadcrumbs and lemon peel powder. This hands-on activity highlighted the creative reuse of food by-products and demonstrated our students’ commitment to sustainability and innovation.

A proud highlight of the event was when our students presented their sustainability projects to Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong, confidently sharing Hougang Secondary's ongoing efforts in applied learning, innovation, community engagement, and environmental stewardship.

Together, these activities exemplify our school’s dedication to nurturing values, promoting sustainable living, and empowering students to make a positive impact—both within the school and beyond.

### RHD Collaboration with CCE
“Flavours of Harmony” is a Secondary 3 Nutrition &amp; Food Science initiative designed to empower students to appreciate Singapore’s rich multicultural heritage, innovate responsibly, and build social cohesion through meaningful food experiences. Through this programme, students explore how food represents cultural identity, deepening their understanding of the diverse traditions that shape our community. 

The project is closely aligned with CCE: Building Consensus &amp; Celebrating Diversity, and is carried out in conjunction with Racial Harmony Day, allowing students to experience first-hand how shared food experiences can promote respect, unity, and appreciation for different cultures.

### Enrichment Programme
At Hougang Secondary, we are always committed to improving our culinary skills through meaningful hands-on learning experiences. This year, our Secondary 3 students took part in an engaging culinary session at Kitchen Showdown, where they had the opportunity to work collaboratively and challenge themselves in a real kitchen environment.

Besides fostering bonding and teamwork, students were tasked with preparing three dishes, including a creative pizza challenge. Using a variety of ingredients provided, they had to design unique pizza toppings, showcase their creativity, and present their dishes professionally.

The experience not only strengthened their culinary techniques but also nurtured critical thinking, adaptability, and confidence — essential skills for both the kitchen and beyond.
