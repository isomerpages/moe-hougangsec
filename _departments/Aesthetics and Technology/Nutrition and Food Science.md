Here in HS, the students are encouraged to explore into the world of Food Sciences and out of the typical classroom experience through our enrichment and innovation programme.

**Secondary 3 Food & Nutrition Enrichment Programme “Cookyn with Carbs”**
  
An enrichment programme was planned for the Secondary 3 students in September for an ‘out of the classroom’ experience. The theme chosen was on carbohydrates where students were actively engaged in making their own fresh pasta and salted egg sauce. Accompanying this dish, they also made breaded chicken thigh. They also learnt to plate their cooked dishes. It was an enriching experience for the students.

  

**Students reflections**

_“It was an interesting experience as we do not get to do this every day in the class!”_

_“The lesson in this enrichment course not only reinforces the teaching I got from my teacher, but also allows me to explore further in the world of food sciences”_

### Secondary 2 Innovation Project

The secondary 2 project was on the school innovation initiatives. They were exposed to the FIDS framework to explore the nutritional needs for one assigned target age group (children, teenagers, adults or elderly) followed by preparing, cooking and serving a healthy and interesting one dish meal.

  

**Feel**

The students were given a task to feel on the topic and task to research on the nutritional needs and factors to consider when planning meals for the target group.

**Imagine**

Students were paired and grouped to research on a given task that is on the nutritional needs of different age groups such as the Young Children, School-going children, Teenagers, Young Adults, Elderly.

**Do** 

Students then need to prepare, cook and serve a healthy and interesting one dish meal suitable for that target group. The students will decide and cook for their assigned target group. They then carried out their practical examination on preparing these dishes.

**Share**

  

The students also shared their cooked product and they shared with the class on why the food is suitable for the assigned target group.

  

  

### SINO-SG Exchange

  

HS hosted a 3-day school visit with Haikou No 1. Middle school and as part of their learning in HS, our FCE Unit was delighted to share a hands-on Food Culture lesson with them. The students created the dish “Roti Jala” and tasted the dish with chicken curry. They also learnt the diverse culture and races in Singapore.
