Here in HS, we hope to be an active platform for our students to experience, explore and enjoy Art. We encourage them to record, observe and make meaning of what they see, allowing them to understand the values and relevance of art in our world.

Our goals:

1. To create an environment with opportunities for students to develop a critical eye for visual art and demonstrate ingenuity in their art making process.
2. Provide in-school, as well as, out-of-school experiences to inspire and cultivate art appreciation in students.
3. Encourage the expression and reflection of thoughts through the making and critique of art.

Encourages every student to recognise the value of art through its historical and cultural context

**Lower Secondary Lesson**   
Lower Secondary Art lesson aims to give students a glimpse of the various art media. Encouraging creative expression and imaginative play in the art making process.
