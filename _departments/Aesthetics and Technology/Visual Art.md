Here in HS, we hope to be an active platform for our students to experience, explore and enjoy Art. We encourage them to record, observe and make meaning of what they see, allowing them to understand the values and relevance of art in our world.

Our goals:

1. To create an environment with opportunities for students to develop a critical eye for visual art and demonstrate ingenuity in their art making process.
2. Provide in-school, as well as, out-of-school experiences to inspire and cultivate art appreciation in students.
3. Encourage the expression and reflection of thoughts through the making and critique of art.

Encourages every student to recognise the value of art through its historical and cultural context

**Lower Secondary Lesson**   
Lower Secondary Art lesson aims to give students a glimpse of the various art media. Encouraging creative expression and imaginative play in the art making process.

**Art Competitions and Learning Journeys:**

Our students are given opportunities to participate in Art Competitions and events and have received accolades in major art events, such as Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition and IgnITE Skills Challenge.

Students also have the opportunity to get inspired and broaden their learning experiences beyond the walls of the classroom. The unit organized Learning Journeys to Art events such as ART STAGE, SYF Exhibition and visits to Secondary schools (Victoria, Zhong Hua, CHIJ, Orchid Park) and Art Museums.

**Secondary 3 Art Enrichment**

Secondary 3 Art students can look forward to an exciting range of media, such as ceramics, digital art, painting, photography and printmaking.
