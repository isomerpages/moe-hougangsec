### HS Art Education
In HS, we aim to be an active platform for our students to experience, explore and enjoy Art. Students are encouraged to observe, record and make meaning of what they see, helping them recognise the relevance and value of art in their everyday lives. 

**Our Goals**:  
We strive to create an environment where students develop a critical eye for visual art and show ingenuity in their art-making processes.

We provide both in-school and out-of-school learning opportunities to inspire and cultivate art appreciation.

We encourage students to express and reflect on their thoughts through the making, discussion and critique of art.

We guide every student to recognise the value of art through its historical, cultural and contemporary contexts.

### Our Platforms for Learning and Showcase

**Art Learning Wall**

The Art Learning Wall is a dedicated space in school that documents students’ creative processes, ideas and reflections. It allows students to see examples of art thinking, gather inspiration from peers and learn the value of process in art-making. The wall acts as a visual learning resource that supports observation, discussion and critique across all levels.

**HS Art E_Gallery**

The HS Art E-Gallery is our digital exhibition platform where students’ artworks are curated and displayed in a museum-like setting. It provides an authentic space for students to present their work, articulate their artistic intentions and experience what it means to be both artist and viewer. The E-Gallery also serves as a teaching and learning resource, allowing students to revisit artworks, study techniques and strengthen visual analysis skills.

**Lower Secondary Art** 

Lower Secondary Art introduces students to a range of media and practices. Lessons encourage creative expression, experimentation and imaginative play, giving students the space to explore their own artistic ideas.

The programme builds on the core learning experiences of observing, exploring, creating and responding. Through hands-on activities, guided discussions and exposure to diverse artists and cultures, students develop visual awareness, interpretive skills and confidence in expressing their ideas.

These foundational experiences prepare students for deeper and more independent art learning in upper secondary.

**Upper Secondary Art**

Upper Secondary Art deepens students’ skills through a structured creative process involving research, idea development, composition and refinement. Students work with traditional and contemporary media such as batik, ceramics, digital art, painting, photography, printmaking and mixed media.

To broaden their perspectives, students participate in Learning Journeys to institutions such as the National Gallery Singapore, the Asian Civilisation Museum and major art exhibitions. These authentic experiences allow them to encounter artworks first-hand, understand how artists communicate meaning, and appreciate art across cultures and contexts.
Through both studio practice and real-world exposure, students strengthen their visual analysis, interpretation and critical thinking skills. By the end of the programme, they are able to produce resolved artworks that demonstrate creativity, technical competence and a clear personal voice.
