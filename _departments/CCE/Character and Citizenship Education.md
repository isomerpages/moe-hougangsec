<h1>Character and Citizenship Education</h1>
<p>At <strong>Hougang Secondary School</strong>, we believe that education
is more than academic achievement — it is about nurturing well-rounded
individuals who will make a positive difference in society. To<strong> Make the Difference,</strong> we
are committed to providing a <strong>holistic education</strong> that develops
every student’s character, values, and sense of active citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>CCE</strong> is not a standalone subject; it is <strong>woven into every aspect of school life</strong> —
from classroom learning and co-curricular activities to student leadership
opportunities and school-wide initiatives. With our <strong>GREAT values</strong> at
the heart of all we do, we seek to nurture <strong>confident future-ready learners</strong> equipped
with the 21st-century competencies to thrive in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<h2><strong>Programme Overview</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>CCE Programme</strong> is guided by the <strong>MOE CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework (Figure 1)</strong>,
our school’s <strong>GREAT values and Desired Outcomes (Figure 2)</strong>.
Together, they form the foundation of our efforts to shape students into
responsible, resilient, and reflective individuals who are morally upright
and citizens who actively contribute to society.</p>
<h3><strong>CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE 2021 provides an <strong>integrated and coherent approach</strong> to
developing students’ character, values, social-emotional well-being, and
citizenship dispositions. It aims to nurture in every student:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Good Character</strong> –
grounded in sound moral values and integrity</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-being</strong> –
equipped to manage challenges with confidence and empathy</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Future Readiness</strong> –
adaptable and innovative in a dynamic world</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Active Citizenship</strong> –
committed to contributing meaningfully to family, community, and nation</p>
<p>The curriculum is anchored in three big ideas — <strong>Identity, Relationships, and Choices</strong> —
which guide students in understanding who they are, how they relate to
others, and how they make responsible decisions.</p>
<p>These ideas are explored through six key <strong>Curriculum Content Areas</strong>:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>National Education (NE)</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Mental Health</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Family Education</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p>Through these content areas and school programmes, students learn to discover
their personal best, make values-driven choices, build meaningful relationships,
and develop a strong sense of purpose as they become future-ready learners,
empowered leaders, resilient innovators and community builders.</p>
