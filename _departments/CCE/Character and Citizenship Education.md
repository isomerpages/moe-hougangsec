<h1>Character and Citizenship Education</h1>
<p>The school believes in providing a holistic education for every student.
Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integrated into instructional
programmes, co-curricular programmes and other learning experiences. The
design and delivery of CCE lessons package and programmes in HS are guided
by the school’s GREAT values and vision statement to nurture empowered,
future-ready Hougeans of character and purpose.</p>
