<h1><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong></h1>
<p>At Hougang Secondary, our <strong>ECG programme</strong> supports students
in developing a strong sense of purpose and direction, preparing them to
be <strong>future-ready learners</strong>. Guided by the ECG Goals of <em>discovering purpose, exploring opportunities,</em> and <em>staying relevant</em>,
students are encouraged to take ownership of their learning journey while
developing self-awareness, resilience, adaptability, and a growth mindset.</p>
<h2><strong>Tiered ECG Support</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Tier 1 Support</strong></h3>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students engage in <strong>customised Student Development Experiences</strong> such
as career talks, career fairs, and open house visits to post-secondary
institutions. Through CCE lessons, students are taught to use the <strong>MySkillsFuture Student Portal</strong> (
