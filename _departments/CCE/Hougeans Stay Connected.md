School is never the same without classmates and teachers. Yet Hougeans continue to stay connected and learn with their classmates and teachers during this HBL period.This video captures encouraging messages from students and teachers to remind one another to stay strong, stay connected and stay gritty! We can get through this challenge together and see one another in school soon!
