<h1><strong>National Education (NE)</strong></h1>
<p>As part of <strong>CCE,</strong>  <strong>NE</strong> plays a vital role in
nurturing our students into confident, values-driven community builders,
guided by our school’s <strong>GREAT values — Gratitude, Respect, Empathy, Adaptability, and Trustworthiness</strong>.</p>
<p>Through meaningful CCE lessons, commemorative events, and experiential
learning, students deepen their understanding of Singapore’s history, shared
values, and the collective responsibility of nation-building.</p>
<p>Our students participated in 4 key NE experiences such as <strong>Total Defence Day</strong>, <strong>International Friendship Day</strong>, <strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong>,
and <strong>National Day Celebrations</strong> — each reinforcing unity,
resilience, and inclusiveness. From the <strong>Food Resilience Experience</strong> marking <strong>60 years of Total Defence in 2025</strong> to
the upcoming <strong>Energy Disruption Experience</strong>, students demonstrated <strong>adaptability</strong> and <strong>trustworthiness</strong> in
responding to national challenges. Through <strong>Gratitude Projects</strong> —
from supporting migrant workers during International Friendship Day to
sharing their aspirations and commitment to Singapore’s continued progress
during National Day — students expressed <strong>gratitude</strong>, <strong>empathy</strong>,
and <strong>respect</strong> for the diverse contributions that strengthen
our nation.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Learning Journey to the National Museum</strong> enabled Secondary
2 students to connect personally with Singapore’s heritage, nurturing a
deeper <strong>respect</strong> for our nation’s journey. Meanwhile, the <strong>NRIC Issuance Ceremony</strong> and <strong>National Service sharing</strong> for
Upper Secondary students instilled a sense of <strong>responsibility</strong> and <strong>trustworthiness</strong> as
they embraced their roles as citizens. The <strong>Internationalisation Programme</strong> for
interested Secondary 3 students further developed <strong>civic literacy</strong> and <strong>global awareness</strong>,
encouraging them to appreciate and adapt to diverse cultures beyond Singapore.</p>
<p>Through these purposeful experiences, our students are growing into <strong>future-ready learners and empathetic citizens</strong> —
resilient and proud of their national identity, anchored in <strong>GREAT values</strong>,
and ready to make the difference in Singapore.</p>
