<h3>Programmes and Activities</h3>
<p><strong>1. Academic Programmes</strong>
<br><strong>School-wide Reading Programme</strong>
<br>Our specially selected range of magazines offer diverse content in each
issue aligned thematically to our syllabus content to engage students.
The objectives of our reading programme are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Promoting reading and literacy to allow students to explore themes and
text types to enhance their language skills and build on their content
knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making meaningful connections for students to draw links and relevance
to what they learn; and applying to real world contexts and issues outside
the classroom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a diverse range of topics not only caters to different reading
interests but also serves as a springboard to engage students critically,
encouraging them to evaluate sources, identify biases and form opinions
about the topics they read</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>GREAT Moment Sharing</strong>
</p>
<p>Getting students to speak in front of an assembly builds confidence and
improves communication and leadership skills. Students create their 3-minute
speeches based on a school or universal value; or share a current affairs
news or a storybook they have read; deepening their understanding of values
and how they apply to their own lives. Discussing school values in a public
setting reinforces a positive school culture, promoting a shared sense
of purpose and community among students, and sharing current news encourages
students to stay informed about what is happening in the world, helping
them develop into well-rounded, socially aware individuals.</p>
<p><strong>HS Radiowaves</strong>
</p>
<p>Bringing voices to the airwaves, our students host the <strong>HS Radiowaves</strong>,
a school radio programme, which features a team of talented hosts who have
successfully gone through auditions to earn their spot. On Wednesday mornings
in Semester 2, they engage listeners with lively discussions on current
trends and relatable topics, while curating a vibrant playlist of songs
to start the day on a positive note. The programme provides an authentic
platform for students to showcase their oracy and presentation skills,
fostering confidence and creativity in a real-world communication setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Department organised a workshop on <strong>Building Oral Communication and Critical Thinking Skills</strong> for
Secondary 4NA students in 2025. During the workshop, students learned how
to analyse video stimulus and infer broader issues linked to contextual
clues observed. They were guided to interpret any oral question categorically
and respond in a relevant, coherent and analytical manner. Also, students
learned how to organise and elaborate on their responses. At the end of
the course, students were able to verbally present their responses with
an awareness of purpose, audience and context and become more confident
and competent in expressing themselves.</p>
<p><strong>2. Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 4 Debate Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>The Secondary 4 Express students put their wit and words to the test through
a series of intra-class debate rounds, sharpening their oral communication,
critical thinking and persuasive skills. The top team from each class then
advanced to the Inter-Class Debate Challenge, where they competed against
their peers in a spirited exchange of ideas. This experience offered an
authentic platform for students to showcase their confidence, eloquence
and mastery of the English Language — all while engaging in meaningful
discourse on contemporary issues.</p>
