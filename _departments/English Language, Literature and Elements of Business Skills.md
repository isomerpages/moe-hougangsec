### Programmes and Activities

**1. Academic Programmes**  
**School-wide Reading Programme**  
Our specially selected range of magazines offer diverse content in each issue aligned thematically to our syllabus content to engage students. The objectives of our reading programme are: 

*	Promoting reading and literacy to allow students to explore themes and text types to enhance their language skills and build on their content knowledge
* Making meaningful connections for students to draw links and relevance to what they learn; and applying to real world contexts and issues outside the classroom
* Providing a diverse range of topics not only caters to different reading interests but also serves as a springboard to engage students critically, encouraging them to evaluate sources, identify biases and form opinions about the topics they read.

**Literature Theatre Appreciation Programme**
*	The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (Sec 1)  
*	Perfecting Pratas (Sec 2)  
*	I’mperfect Musical Drama (Sec 3)  
*	BOOM Meet the Director and Playwright (Sec 4)


**GREAT Moment Sharing**

Getting students to speak in front of an assembly builds confidence and improves communication and leadership skills. Students create their 3-minute speeches based on a school or universal value; or share a current affairs news or a storybook they have read; deepening their understanding of values and how they apply to their own lives. Discussing school values in a public setting reinforces a positive school culture, promoting a shared sense of purpose and community among students, and sharing current news encourages students to stay informed about what is happening in the world, helping them develop into well-rounded, socially aware individuals.
