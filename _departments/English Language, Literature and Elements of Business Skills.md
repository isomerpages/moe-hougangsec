<h3>Curriculum/Subject Offered</h3>

<h3>Programmes and Activities</h3>
<p><strong>1. Academic Programmes</strong>
<br><strong>School-wide Reading Programme</strong>
<br>Our specially selected range of magazines offer diverse content in each
issue aligned thematically to our syllabus content to engage students.
The objectives of our reading programme are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Promoting reading and literacy to allow students to explore themes and
text types to enhance their language skills and build on their content
knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making meaningful connections for students to draw links and relevance
to what they learn; and applying to real world contexts and issues outside
the classroom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a diverse range of topics not only caters to different reading
interests but also serves as a springboard to engage students critically,
encouraging them to evaluate sources, identify biases and form opinions
about the topics they read.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literature Theatre Appreciation Programme</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (Sec 1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perfecting Pratas (Sec 2)</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GREAT Moment Sharing</strong>
</p>
<p>Getting students to speak in front of an assembly builds confidence and
improves communication and leadership skills. Students create their 3-minute
speeches based on a school or universal value; or share a current affairs
news or a storybook they have read; deepening their understanding of values
and how they apply to their own lives. Discussing school values in a public
setting reinforces a positive school culture, promoting a shared sense
of purpose and community among students, and sharing current news encourages
students to stay informed about what is happening in the world, helping
them develop into well-rounded, socially aware individuals.</p>
