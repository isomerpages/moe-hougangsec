Aristotle once said, _"For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.”_

Simply put, knowledge is gained by making meaning from direct experiences, a theory popularized by renowned American educational theorist, David A. Kolb.

At HSS, the inquiry approach is the cornerstone to our students’ learning. Our students learn how to gather relevant information, to make sense of them meaningfully, and to draw well-reasoned conclusions supported by evidence. To facilitate the learning, the department organises numerous learning journeys to support the inquiry process.

Within the classrooms, student-centred pedagogies such as Collaborative Learning and Student Directed Learning are widely used to engage our learners. The department has also incorporated thinking routines from Harvard’s Making Thinking Visible into the curriculum to build a classroom culture and community of enthusiastically engaged thinkers and learners. Different ICT tools such as Nearpod, Kahoot and Padlet are employed by the teachers to support Blended Learning.

  

### Vision

Nurturing lifelong learners in the study of Humanities

### Geography

For Geographical Inquiry (GI), our Secondary 1 students will do field studies in school to conduct water quality studies. The Secondary 2 students will visit a nearby neighbourhood estate on their own to conduct qualitative studies on housing issues. The Secondary 3 and Secondary 4 students will also conduct field studies at Gardens By the Bay, Art Science Museum and Marina Barrage to enhance their understanding on the challenges and solutions of Singapore’s urban development.

### History

For Historical Inquiry (HI), Secondary 1 students will be doing an experiential archeological-based historical investigation towards gaining knowledge of Singapore’s 700-year history. This will be done in school. The Secondary 2 students will visit the National Museum of Singapore for their historical investigation on the Japanese Occupation. Through this historical investigation, students will learn more about the history of the Singapore through hands-on activities outside the classroom.

### Social Studies

Secondary Three students formed groups of 5 and played the Singaporean Dream Card game to learn some Social Studies related concepts such as Socio-economic Status, National Identity and the trade-offs. Students enjoyed the game as they take on different identities and familiarise themselves with some terms and language that are unique to Singaporeans. They also learnt of the laws and norms that are found in Singapore, and the issues surrounding them.   

### Earth Week and Scitechumatics

The department also runs the Earth Week programme towards raising Environmental awareness among the school staff and students. Through the activities organised during the week, students get to visit exhibits and take part in activities which help to shape their environmental consciousness.

  

The department also work with other departments to ensure that environmental-related concepts are taught during that week. Students will get to embark on special environmental projects related to the respective subjects.

  

For SciTechHumatics, the department collaborates with other departments within the school (Science, D&T and Mathematics) to run a series of challenges for students to take part in. Students learn to cross-apply their learning from different disciplines to solve the challenges presented.
