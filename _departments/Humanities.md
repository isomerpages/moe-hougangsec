Aristotle once said, “*For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them*.”  

Simply put, knowledge is gained by making meaning from direct experiences, a theory popularized by renowned American educational theorist, David A. Kolb.  

At HSS, the inquiry approach is the cornerstone to our students’ learning. Our students learn how to gather relevant information, to make sense of them meaningfully, and to draw well-reasoned conclusions supported by evidence. To facilitate the learning, the department organises numerous learning journeys to support the inquiry process.  

Within the classrooms, student-centred pedagogies such as Collaborative Learning and Student Directed Learning are widely used to engage our learners. The department has also incorporated thinking routines from Harvard’s Making Thinking Visible into the curriculum to build a classroom culture and community of enthusiastically engaged thinkers and learners. Different ICT tools such as Nearpod, Kahoot and Padlet are employed by the teachers to support Blended Learning.


  

### Vision

Nurturing lifelong learners in the study of Humanities

### Lower Secondary 

#### Geographical Investigation (GI)

<u>Sec 1</u>   
Sec 1 students conducted their GI via water testing at the school’s ponds. They took samples of water from the ponds and used the water test kits to test pH of the water and examine its quality. This allowed for a hands-on activity for students to test real-world issues such as the water of ponds. 

<u>Sec 2</u>  
Singapore has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in the world. It is estimated that by 2030, one in four people will be aged over 65 years, and that this will rise to almost one in two by 2050. Sec 2 students were tasked to investigate the guiding question,”Is Hougang an elderly-friendly neighbourhood?”  The students embark on a self directed group project where they conduct surveys, collect, analyse and present their data. They will then come out with a conclusion and a reflection on the whole process of  their investigation.


#### Historical Investigation (HI)

<u>Sec 1</u>   
This year, the Secondary One students visited two museums - the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall and the National Museum of Singapore. They looked through the artefacts and exhibits on display to help them in their investigation of life in Colonial Singapore. Gathering evidence by photographing relevant exhibits and applying their newly learnt historical thinking concepts, the students were able to make inferences about Singapore’s past. HI learning journeys indeed sparked joy in the students’ learning as they brought history to life, outside the classroom. 

<u>Sec 2</u>   
This year, the Secondary Two students went through a series of museum virtual tours designed by our very own Secondary Two history teachers. This was an opportunity to sculpt students’ learning experience by helping them delve into the traumas and heart wrenching episodes of World War 2 and the Japanese Occupation.  

After collecting photos and short video clips from National Museum, Changi Chapel Museum and Ford Factory Museum, the teachers edited and then uploaded the series of virtual tours onto the Student Learning Space to let the students experience them on their own. The virtual tour allowed them to view the exhibitions at their own pace and conduct investigations without stepping into the three museums physically.  

The students then used the “PAGES” app to fill up a guided template which led them through the historical investigation process.  

<u>Istana Heritage Challenge</u>   
Sec Two students visited the Istana Heritage Gallery and participated in an exciting  historical discovery. They were able to examine the artefacts and exhibits of the gallery and learn about the iconic Istana and its rich heritage. Moreover, it provided the students glimpses into the lives of our Presidents and Singapore’s diplomatic relations with other nations.


### Upper Secondary   
#### Geographical Investigation  
<u>Sec 4/5</u>  
The Humanities Department has organized a Geographical Investigation (GI) for our Sec 4 and 5 Geography Elective students held at Jewel Changi Airport. Through this activity, students will be able to conduct data gathering and extend their classroom learning through direct observation and experience. 

Their investigation revolved around the number of visitors that flock to Jewel and if there was a correlation to the either the variety of attractions and amenities found at Jewel, or the variety of food and beverage establishments present in the area.  
Students were tasked to conduct the following:  
●	Detailed land use survey  
●	Pedestrian count  
●	Observation through annotated photographs  

After which, they took their primary data back to the classroom to make sense of the data after visually representing it and discussing as a group.

Stretch Programmes  
History Challenge  
2 Sec Three students participated in the MOE History Challenge through SLS. They were able to understand more about the study of history through the questions asked. This year, there were over 400 students from 120 schools who participated in this competition. 

Appeasement Board Game   
Sec Three students played a board game about the Appeasement Policy, which was the prelude to the outbreak of World War II in Europe. They were able to play the roles of different countries and step into the shoes of key historical figures like PM Neveille Chamberlain. Game-based-learning allows students to apply historical thinking and analyse historical events. 

World Vision   
As part of the Geography Unit’s stretch programme for the higher ability students, selected students attended a movie screening titled “Thank You for the Rain”. The documentary captures the journey of a Kenyan farmer challenged by climate change to that of an activist on the global stage. After the screening, there was a talk conducted by World Vision where students will learn more about and discuss global and local efforts in tackling climate change.

Gardens By The Bay  
As part of the Social Studies Unit’s stretch programme for the higher ability students, selected students attended a learning journey at Gardens By The Bay to learn about Singapore’s land reclamation efforts. Through the story of Marina Bay, students appreciate how the nation overcomes land scarcity, what land reclamation is and how land is used sustainably and efficiently in our city.




### Social Studies

Secondary Three students formed groups of 5 and played the Singaporean Dream Card game to learn some Social Studies related concepts such as Socio-economic Status, National Identity and the trade-offs. Students enjoyed the game as they take on different identities and familiarise themselves with some terms and language that are unique to Singaporeans. They also learnt of the laws and norms that are found in Singapore, and the issues surrounding them.&nbsp;  

### Earth Week and Scitechumatics

The department also runs the Earth Week programme towards raising Environmental awareness among the school staff and students. Through the activities organised during the week, students get to visit exhibits and take part in activities which help to shape their environmental consciousness.

  

The department also work with other departments to ensure that environmental-related concepts are taught during that week. Students will get to embark on special environmental projects related to the respective subjects.

  

For SciTechHumatics, the department collaborates with other departments within the school (Science, D&amp;T and Mathematics) to run a series of challenges for students to take part in. Students learn to cross-apply their learning from different disciplines to solve the challenges presented.
