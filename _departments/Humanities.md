<p>Aristotle once said, “<em>For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them</em>.”</p>
<p>Simply put, knowledge is gained by making meaning from direct experiences,
a theory popularized by renowned American educational theorist, David A.
Kolb.</p>
<p>At HSS, the inquiry approach is the cornerstone to our students’ learning.
Our students learn how to gather relevant information, to make sense of
them meaningfully, and to draw well-reasoned conclusions supported by evidence.
To facilitate the learning, the department organises numerous learning
journeys to support the inquiry process.</p>
<p>Within the classrooms, student-centred pedagogies such as Collaborative
Learning and Student Directed Learning are widely used to engage our learners.
The department has also incorporated thinking routines from Harvard’s Making
Thinking Visible into the curriculum to build a classroom culture and community
of enthusiastically engaged thinkers and learners. Different ICT tools
such as Nearpod, Kahoot and Padlet are employed by the teachers to support
Blended Learning.</p>

<p>Nurturing lifelong learners in the study of Humanities</p>
<h3>Lower Secondary</h3>
<h4>Geographical Investigation (GI)</h4>
<p><u>Sec 1</u>
<br>Sec 1 students conducted their GI via water testing at the school’s ponds.
They took samples of water from the ponds and used the water test kits
to test pH of the water and examine its quality. This allowed for a hands-on
activity for students to test real-world issues such as the water of ponds.</p>

<p><u>Sec 2</u>
<br>Singapore has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in the world.
It is estimated that by 2030, one in four people will be aged over 65 years,
and that this will rise to almost one in two by 2050. Sec 2 students were
tasked to investigate the guiding question,”Is Hougang an elderly-friendly
neighbourhood?” The students embark on a self directed group project where
they conduct surveys, collect, analyse and present their data. They will
then come out with a conclusion and a reflection on the whole process of
their investigation.</p>
<h4>Historical Investigation (HI)</h4>
<p><u>Sec 1</u>
<br>This year, the Secondary One students visited two museums - the SGH Museum
and the National Museum of Singapore. They looked through the artefacts
and exhibits on display to help them in their investigation of life in
Colonial Singapore. Gathering evidence by photographing relevant exhibits
and applying their newly learnt historical thinking concepts, the students
were able to make inferences about Singapore’s past. HI learning journeys
indeed sparked joy in the students’ learning as they brought history to
life, outside the classroom.</p>

</p>
<p><u>Sec 2</u>
<br>This year, the Secondary Two students went through a series of museum
virtual tours designed by our very own Secondary Two history teachers.
This was an opportunity to sculpt students’ learning experience by helping
them delve into the traumas and heart wrenching episodes of World War 2
and the Japanese Occupation.</p>
<p>After collecting photos and short video clips from National Museum, Changi
Chapel Museum and Ford Factory Museum, the teachers edited and then uploaded
the series of virtual tours onto the Student Learning Space to let the
students experience them on their own. The virtual tour allowed them to
view the exhibitions at their own pace and conduct investigations without
stepping into the three museums physically.</p>
<p>The students then used the “PAGES” app to fill up a guided template which
led them through the historical investigation process.</p>

<p><u>Istana Heritage Challenge</u>
<br>Sec Two students visited the Istana Heritage Gallery and participated
in an exciting historical discovery. They were able to examine the artefacts
and exhibits of the gallery and learn about the iconic Istana and its rich
heritage. Moreover, it provided the students glimpses into the lives of
our Presidents and Singapore’s diplomatic relations with other nations.</p>

<p><u>History Challenge</u>
<br>2 Sec Three students participated in the MOE History Challenge through
SLS. They were able to understand more about the study of history through
the questions asked. This year, there were over 400 students from 120 schools
who participated in this competition.</p>
<p><u>Appeasement Board Game</u>
<br>Sec Three students played a board game about the Appeasement Policy, which
was the prelude to the outbreak of World War II in Europe. They were able
to play the roles of different countries and step into the shoes of key
historical figures like PM Neveille Chamberlain. Game-based-learning allows
students to apply historical thinking and analyse historical events.</p>

<p><u>World Vision</u>
<br>As part of the Geography Unit’s stretch programme for the higher ability
students, selected students attended a movie screening titled “Thank You
for the Rain”. The documentary captures the journey of a Kenyan farmer
challenged by climate change to that of an activist on the global stage.
After the screening, there was a talk conducted by World Vision where students
will learn more about and discuss global and local efforts in tackling
climate change.

<p><u>Social Studies Stretch Programme to Changi Experience Studio</u>
</p>
<p>As part of the Social Studies Unit’s stretch programme for the higher
ability students, selected students attended a learning journey at the
Changi Experience Studio at Jewel to learn about Changi Airport’s history
and functions. Through the story of Changi Airport, students appreciate
how the airport plays a critical role in Singapore’s economy and connection
to the rest of the world.</p>
<h4>Internationalisation Trip to Vietnam, May 2023</h4>
<p>The Humanities Department organised the first learning journey after the
pandemic to Vietnam. During the 5 Day 4 Night trip to Ho Chi Min City and
Vung Tau City, students experienced the rich cultural, historical and geographical
features of Vietnam. Students visited sites which helped them understand
the rich and difficult history of the Vietnam War - through the Cu Chi
Tunnels and War Remants Museum.</p>
<p>Students also visited different cultural and religious sites such as the
statue of Jesus and buddhist/Vietnamese temples at Vung Tau City. They
also visited a Vietnamese mosque at Ho Chi Min City. Through the visit
of these sites, students learnt about local tourism and the rich diversity
of cultures in Vietnam. Through the visit to the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial
Park 1, students also learnt about the important bilateral trade ties between
Singapore and Vietnam.

<h4>Internationalisation Trip to Bali, Oct 2023</h4>
<p>Our school's journey to Bali offers a unique Humanities learning opportunity
with an added focus on understanding tourism in this enchanting island.
Students immerse in the Balinese way of life, including an immersion program
with Sekolah Negari Satu Denpasar to gain insights into education in Bali.
From mastering traditional dance and gamelan rhythms to exploring the UNESCO-recognized
Subak rice production system, they learn about the island's rich culture
and environmental practices. Additionally, students get to explore the
dynamics of tourism in Bali, witnessing how this industry interacts with
the region's geography. Bali's lush landscapes and vibrant traditions offer
an enriching educational adventure, turning the entire island into a living
Humanities classroom.</p>
