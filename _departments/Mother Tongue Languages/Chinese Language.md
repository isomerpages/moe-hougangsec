#### Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition   
The Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition is an exciting event aimed at fostering cultural awareness and celebrating the rich traditions of the Chinese New Year within Hougang Secondary School. The primary objective of this competition is to engage students, teachers, and staff in a creative and educational experience that goes beyond the typical classroom setting. By encouraging participants to decorate their classrooms in accordance with the Chinese New Year theme, we aim to promote cross-cultural understanding, appreciation of diversity, and respect for the Chinese cultural heritage.  
Through this competition, we hope to provide a platform for students to learn about the customs, symbols, and significance of the Chinese New Year, all while promoting teamwork and creativity. The event also serves as an opportunity for students to develop essential skills such as research, teamwork, and communication as they collaborate to design and execute their decorative ideas.

#### Hougang Secondary School Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) Programme 2023   
On 31 July 2023, the Secondary 1 Chinese Language students felt the charm of traditional opera up close at Tampines East Community Club through watching the Peking Opera performance "The Monkey King Borrow Treasure from Dragon Palace".  

The play was performed by Mr Guo Xuqian, Artistic Director of the Singapore Chinese Arts Centre, and his team. The play consists of performances, martial arts, tumbling skills, and interactive sessions. Students reacted with enthusiasm to the amazing martial arts scenes and interactions on and off the stage. Many students said that it was their first time watching a Peking Opera performance. Nevertheless, they found that it was very different from the performances they had seen before. The content was easy to understand, and the performance was relatively interesting.   

At the end of the performance, Mr Guo gave an introduction to Peking Opera. Students get to know the types of Peking Opera and the classification of characters based on the roles. When it came to the final interactive session, students were all eager to try and experience the recitation of the main character's monologue. Through watching the Peking Opera performance, students had an in-depth understanding of traditional Chinese opera culture, thus cultivating their interest in Chinese culture.
