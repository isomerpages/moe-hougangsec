### **Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight 2023**   

The MTL Fortnight is an annual program designed to create an immersive environment for students to learn and appreciate Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. It aims to make MTL learning engaging and relevant by offering a range of activities that bring language and culture to life.  

The program seeks to broaden students' horizons by providing opportunities for them to explore and experience their own cultural traditions. Through diverse cultural activities, students can deepen their understanding of their heritage, values, and cultural identity.  

Ultimately, the MTL Fortnight aims to deepen students’ interests in learning mother-tongue languages, doing so in a fun setting outside of traditional classroom activities.  We believe that stimulating students’ interests in the languages and cultures are key to getting students motivated in learning.    

Program Organization and Activities:  

The MTL Fortnight is organized within a designated two-week period, one week in Semester 1 and the other in Semester 2.   The programme includes a range of activities to achieve its objectives. Some of the planned activities include:  

- Language and Cultural Workshops: Various workshops are conducted to provide students with hands-on experiences related to language and culture. These workshops can cover aspects such as traditional art, music, dance and culinary practices.  
  
- Communication Competitions: Activities like debates, speeches, and recitation contests are organized to encourage students to actively use their mother tongue language and to improve their communication skills.  

- Interactive Productions: Creative projects such as audio drama production allow students to collaborate, use their language skills and express themselves in culturally meaningful ways.  

- Cultural Appreciation: Students are encouraged to reflect on their cultural identity and share personal stories related to their heritage. This fosters a deeper connection to their roots and a sense of belonging.  

In summary, the MTL Fortnight serves as an immersive platform for students to learn and appreciate their Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Fun and engaging activities are curated to stimulate students’ interests, motivating them to learn more.
