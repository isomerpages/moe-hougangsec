<h4>Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition</h4>
<p>The Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition is an exciting event
aimed at fostering cultural awareness and celebrating the rich traditions
of the Chinese New Year within Hougang Secondary School. The primary objective
of this competition is to engage students, teachers, and staff in a creative
and educational experience that goes beyond the typical classroom setting.
By encouraging participants to decorate their classrooms in accordance
with the Chinese New Year theme, we aim to promote cross-cultural understanding,
appreciation of diversity, and respect for the Chinese cultural heritage.
<br>Through this competition, we hope to provide a platform for students to
learn about the customs, symbols, and significance of the Chinese New Year,
all while promoting teamwork and creativity. The event also serves as an
opportunity for students to develop essential skills such as research,
teamwork, and communication as they collaborate to design and execute their
decorative ideas.</p>

<h4>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) Programme 2025</h4>
<p>On 27 March 2025, the Secondary 1 students from Hougang Secondary School
had the opportunity to watch the engaging stage play Zhou Chu and the Three
Monsters, adapted from a historical story set in the Jin Dynasty. This
learning experience, part of the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)
by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), aims to
expose students to Chinese dramas and Chinese language-related performances
by local or overseas arts groups. Additionally, we seeks to foster students’
interest in their cultural heritage and cultivate future Hougang Secondary
students who are morally grounded, purposeful, and capable of achieving
their goals.</p>
<p>The play tells the tale of Zhou Chu, a young man who lost his parents
early in life and grew up without proper guidance. Though brave and strong,
he often caused trouble and was feared as one of the “three villains” in
his village. Eventually, Zhou Chu turned over a new leaf and became a respected
figure in his community.</p>
<p>The interactive performance captivated students, who enthusiastically
responded to the actors and took part in the unfolding story. The lively
mix of humour, action, and engaging dialogue made the play highly enjoyable.
Beyond its entertainment value, the production conveyed meaningful lessons
about change, self-reflection, and personal growth. By the end of the show,
students left not only laughing but also reflecting deeply on character,
values, and redemption.</p>

<h3><strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight 2023 Overview</strong></h3>
<p>The MTL Fortnight is an annual program designed to create an immersive
environment for students to learn and appreciate Mother Tongue Languages
and Cultures. It aims to make MTL learning engaging and relevant by offering
a range of activities that bring language and culture to life.</p>
<p>The program seeks to broaden students' horizons by providing opportunities
for them to explore and experience their own cultural traditions. Through
diverse cultural activities, students can deepen their understanding of
their heritage, values, and cultural identity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the MTL Fortnight aims to deepen students’ interests in learning
mother-tongue languages, doing so in a fun setting outside of traditional
classroom activities. We believe that stimulating students’ interests in
the languages and cultures are key to getting students motivated in learning.</p>
<p>Program Organization and Activities:</p>
<p>The MTL Fortnight is organized within a designated two-week period, one
week in Semester 1 and the other in Semester 2. The programme includes
a range of activities to achieve its objectives. Some of the planned activities
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language and Cultural Workshops: Various workshops are conducted to provide
students with hands-on experiences related to language and culture. These
workshops can cover aspects such as traditional art, music, dance and culinary
practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication Competitions: Activities like debates, speeches, and recitation
contests are organized to encourage students to actively use their mother
tongue language and to improve their communication skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interactive Productions: Creative projects such as audio drama production
allow students to collaborate, use their language skills and express themselves
in culturally meaningful ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Appreciation: Students are encouraged to reflect on their cultural
identity and share personal stories related to their heritage. This fosters
a deeper connection to their roots and a sense of belonging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the MTL Fortnight serves as an immersive platform for students
to learn and appreciate their Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Fun
and engaging activities are curated to stimulate students’ interests, motivating
them to learn more.</p>

<h3>HS MTL Reading Program</h3>
<p><strong>Reading Programme (EL write-up):</strong>
<br>The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Reading Programme at Hougang Secondary
School aims to nurture a culture of reading and instil a lifelong appreciation
for the Mother Tongue languages among students. The programme is designed
to enhance students’ language proficiency, critical thinking, and reflective
abilities through exposure to authentic, meaningful, and engaging texts.</p>
<p>Students explore a wide variety of reading materials, including contemporary
articles, short stories, poems, and excerpts from novels. These texts are
carefully selected to match students’ interests, linguistic levels, and
current social issues relevant to Singapore and the region. Leveraging
their Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), students also access online resources
such as Berita Harian and Lianhe Zaobao to stay informed about contemporary
topics and practise reading authentic materials.</p>
<p>Reading sessions are conducted regularly during curriculum time with structured
activities that focus on comprehension, vocabulary development, and higher-order
thinking skills. As part of post-reading reflection, students share their
perspectives during sessions such as GREAT Moment, where they relate the
themes and values in their readings to the school’s GREAT values</p>
<p>Through this integrated approach, the MTL Reading Programme not only strengthens
students’ mastery of their Mother Tongue languages but also develops independent,
thoughtful, and values-driven learners who can connect language learning
to real-life experiences and character growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reading Programme (ML write-up):</strong>
<br>Program Membaca Bahasa Ibunda (MTL) di Sekolah Menengah Hougang bertujuan
untuk memupuk budaya membaca serta menanamkan apresiasi sepanjang hayat
terhadap bahasa ibunda dalam kalangan pelajar. Program ini dirancang untuk
meningkatkan kecekapan berbahasa, kemahiran berfikir kritikal dan reflektif
pelajar melalui pendedahan kepada bahan bacaan yang autentik, bermakna
dan menarik.</p>
<p>Pelajar didedahkan kepada pelbagai bahan bacaan, termasuk artikel kontemporari,
cerpen, puisi dan petikan daripada novel. Bahan-bahan ini dipilih dengan
teliti agar sesuai dengan minat, tahap kecekapan bahasa dan isu semasa
yang relevan dengan konteks Singapura serta rantau ini. Dengan menggunakan
Peranti Pembelajaran Peribadi (PLD), pelajar turut mengakses sumber dalam
talian seperti Berita Harian dan Lianhe Zaobao untuk mengikuti perkembangan
isu-isu semasa dan melatih kemahiran membaca bahan autentik.</p>
<p>Sesi membaca dijalankan secara berkala dalam waktu kurikulum melalui aktiviti
berstruktur yang menekankan pemahaman, pengayaan kosa kata, dan kemahiran
berfikir aras tinggi. Sebagai sebahagian daripada refleksi pasca bacaan,
pelajar berkongsi pandangan mereka dalam sesi seperti GREAT Moment, dengan
mengaitkan tema dan nilai daripada bahan bacaan kepada nilai-nilai GREAT.</p>
<p>Melalui pendekatan bersepadu ini, Program Membaca Bahasa Ibunda bukan
sahaja memperkukuh penguasaan bahasa pelajar, malah membentuk pelajar yang
berfikiran matang, reflektif dan berteraskan nilai, serta mampu menghubungkan
pembelajaran bahasa dengan pengalaman hidup dan pembangunan sahsiah mereka.</p>
<p>Bagi Program Membaca Bahasa Melayu, elemen gamifikasi telah diperkenalkan
untuk meningkatkan pengalaman membaca. Pelajar mengambil bahagian dalam
cabaran membaca, memperoleh mata dan membuka kunci ganjaran berdasarkan
pencapaian bacaan mereka. Pendekatan ini memupuk persaingan yang sihat
dan menjadikan pembacaan lebih menarik.</p>

<h3><strong>GREAT MOMENT</strong></h3>
<p>GREAT 是我们后港中学五项核心价值观的首字母缩写，分别代表：</p>
<p>• 感恩（Gratitude）：培养学生对他人和社会的感激之情，学会珍惜生活中的每一个机会。</p>
<p>• 尊重（Respect）：强调尊重他人、尊重不同意见，建立和谐的人际关系。</p>
<p>• 同理心（Empathy）：鼓励学生站在他人立场上理解和关怀，促进情感交流和社会责任感。</p>
<p>• 适应力（Adaptability）：帮助学生培养应对变化和挑战的能力，适应不断变化的环境。</p>
<p>• 诚信（Trustworthiness）：树立诚信为本的价值观，鼓励学生言行一致，建立个人和集体的信任。</p>
<p>为了加深学生对这些核心价值观的理解，我校在每个偶数周的早晨开展以华语进行的分享和心得交流活动。在这些活动中，学生们不仅能深入探讨每项价值观的实际意义，还能通过分享个人体验和反思，将这些价值观有意识地融入到日常的学习与生活中。通过这种互动式的学习方式，学生们能够在实际情境中更好地理解和践行学校的核心价值观，从而提升个人素质，培养全面发展的能力。</p>
