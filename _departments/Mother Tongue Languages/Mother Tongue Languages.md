### **Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight 2023 Overview**   

The MTL Fortnight is an annual program designed to create an immersive environment for students to learn and appreciate Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. It aims to make MTL learning engaging and relevant by offering a range of activities that bring language and culture to life.  

The program seeks to broaden students' horizons by providing opportunities for them to explore and experience their own cultural traditions. Through diverse cultural activities, students can deepen their understanding of their heritage, values, and cultural identity.  

Ultimately, the MTL Fortnight aims to deepen students’ interests in learning mother-tongue languages, doing so in a fun setting outside of traditional classroom activities.  We believe that stimulating students’ interests in the languages and cultures are key to getting students motivated in learning.    

Program Organization and Activities:  

The MTL Fortnight is organized within a designated two-week period, one week in Semester 1 and the other in Semester 2.   The programme includes a range of activities to achieve its objectives. Some of the planned activities include:  

- Language and Cultural Workshops: Various workshops are conducted to provide students with hands-on experiences related to language and culture. These workshops can cover aspects such as traditional art, music, dance and culinary practices.  
  
- Communication Competitions: Activities like debates, speeches, and recitation contests are organized to encourage students to actively use their mother tongue language and to improve their communication skills.  

- Interactive Productions: Creative projects such as audio drama production allow students to collaborate, use their language skills and express themselves in culturally meaningful ways.  

- Cultural Appreciation: Students are encouraged to reflect on their cultural identity and share personal stories related to their heritage. This fosters a deeper connection to their roots and a sense of belonging.  

In summary, the MTL Fortnight serves as an immersive platform for students to learn and appreciate their Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Fun and engaging activities are curated to stimulate students’ interests, motivating them to learn more.

#### Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition   
The Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition is an exciting event aimed at fostering cultural awareness and celebrating the rich traditions of the Chinese New Year within Hougang Secondary School. The primary objective of this competition is to engage students, teachers, and staff in a creative and educational experience that goes beyond the typical classroom setting. By encouraging participants to decorate their classrooms in accordance with the Chinese New Year theme, we aim to promote cross-cultural understanding, appreciation of diversity, and respect for the Chinese cultural heritage.  
Through this competition, we hope to provide a platform for students to learn about the customs, symbols, and significance of the Chinese New Year, all while promoting teamwork and creativity. The event also serves as an opportunity for students to develop essential skills such as research, teamwork, and communication as they collaborate to design and execute their decorative ideas.

#### Hougang Secondary School Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) Programme 2023   
On 31 July 2023, the Secondary 1 Chinese Language students felt the charm of traditional opera up close at Tampines East Community Club through watching the Peking Opera performance "The Monkey King Borrow Treasure from Dragon Palace".  

The play was performed by Mr Guo Xuqian, Artistic Director of the Singapore Chinese Arts Centre, and his team. The play consists of performances, martial arts, tumbling skills, and interactive sessions. Students reacted with enthusiasm to the amazing martial arts scenes and interactions on and off the stage. Many students said that it was their first time watching a Peking Opera performance. Nevertheless, they found that it was very different from the performances they had seen before. The content was easy to understand, and the performance was relatively interesting.   

At the end of the performance, Mr Guo gave an introduction to Peking Opera. Students get to know the types of Peking Opera and the classification of characters based on the roles. When it came to the final interactive session, students were all eager to try and experience the recitation of the main character's monologue. Through watching the Peking Opera performance, students had an in-depth understanding of traditional Chinese opera culture, thus cultivating their interest in Chinese culture.
