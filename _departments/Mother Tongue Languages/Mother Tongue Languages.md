<h4>Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition</h4>
<p>The Chinese New Year Classroom Decoration Competition is an exciting event
aimed at fostering cultural awareness and celebrating the rich traditions
of the Chinese New Year within Hougang Secondary School. The primary objective
of this competition is to engage students, teachers, and staff in a creative
and educational experience that goes beyond the typical classroom setting.
By encouraging participants to decorate their classrooms in accordance
with the Chinese New Year theme, we aim to promote cross-cultural understanding,
appreciation of diversity, and respect for the Chinese cultural heritage.
<br>Through this competition, we hope to provide a platform for students to
learn about the customs, symbols, and significance of the Chinese New Year,
all while promoting teamwork and creativity. The event also serves as an
opportunity for students to develop essential skills such as research,
teamwork, and communication as they collaborate to design and execute their
decorative ideas.</p>

<h4>Hougang Secondary School Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) Programme 2024</h4>
<p>On 21 Mar 2024, the Sec 1 students had the opportunity to watch the captivating
fantasy drama <em>Come On! Ryder</em>, a play that explores the theme of
personal growth and resilience. The story follows Ryder, a young protagonist
who embarks on a transformative adventure in a mystical place known as
Adventure Island. On this island, Ryder faces a series of daunting challenges
that test his courage and inner strength.</p>
<p>The narrative centers around the loss and rediscovery of courage. As Ryder
navigates the island, he encounters various obstacles, each symbolizing
different fears and insecurities that people face in life. Along the way,
he learns that the love and support of family and friends can provide the
strength needed to overcome the most difficult situations.</p>
<p>Students were particularly drawn to the dynamic characters and the imaginative
setting of Adventure Island, which featured a colorful, dreamlike world
where the line between reality and fantasy is blurred. The performance
combined storytelling, visual effects, and strong emotional moments, allowing
the audience to experience Ryder’s struggles and triumphs as though they
were on the island with him.</p>
<p>The play’s engaging plot and heartfelt message left a lasting impression
on the students, who found themselves reflecting on the importance of resilience,
bravery, and the power of human connection. By the end of the performance,
it was clear that <em>Come On! Ryder</em> successfully communicated its core
message: no matter how difficult the challenges may seem, with the love
and support of those around us, we can find the strength to persevere.</p>

<p>One unique aspect of the performance was the creative use of large-scale
LEGO props that were built to bring the world of Come On! Ryder to life.
These oversized LEGO structures, including towering buildings, landscapes,
and fantastical creatures, created a visually striking and imaginative
environment on stage.</p>

<h3><strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight 2023 Overview</strong></h3>
<p>The MTL Fortnight is an annual program designed to create an immersive
environment for students to learn and appreciate Mother Tongue Languages
and Cultures. It aims to make MTL learning engaging and relevant by offering
a range of activities that bring language and culture to life.</p>
<p>The program seeks to broaden students' horizons by providing opportunities
for them to explore and experience their own cultural traditions. Through
diverse cultural activities, students can deepen their understanding of
their heritage, values, and cultural identity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the MTL Fortnight aims to deepen students’ interests in learning
mother-tongue languages, doing so in a fun setting outside of traditional
classroom activities. We believe that stimulating students’ interests in
the languages and cultures are key to getting students motivated in learning.</p>
<p>Program Organization and Activities:</p>
<p>The MTL Fortnight is organized within a designated two-week period, one
week in Semester 1 and the other in Semester 2. The programme includes
a range of activities to achieve its objectives. Some of the planned activities
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language and Cultural Workshops: Various workshops are conducted to provide
students with hands-on experiences related to language and culture. These
workshops can cover aspects such as traditional art, music, dance and culinary
practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication Competitions: Activities like debates, speeches, and recitation
contests are organized to encourage students to actively use their mother
tongue language and to improve their communication skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interactive Productions: Creative projects such as audio drama production
allow students to collaborate, use their language skills and express themselves
in culturally meaningful ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Appreciation: Students are encouraged to reflect on their cultural
identity and share personal stories related to their heritage. This fosters
a deeper connection to their roots and a sense of belonging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the MTL Fortnight serves as an immersive platform for students
to learn and appreciate their Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Fun
and engaging activities are curated to stimulate students’ interests, motivating
them to learn more.</p>
