Hougang Secondary School adopts a whole-school holistic approach in managing school discipline with the aim of instilling self-discipline in our pupils. As a community, all Hougeans are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful manner that promotes a conducive environment for learning. Overall, the rules and regulations are designed to create a safe and secure environment for students to learn and teachers to carry out their duties. 

The Pupil Management Department carries out reflection sessions (adapted from the Restorative Approach) with the students to address misbehaviour and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions and come up with solutions. Punishments for offences are accompanied by reflections so that students can understand the rationale for the punishment and learn to be responsible for their own actions.

**ACTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES**

The following describes the possible consequences which will be applied to students who exhibit behaviour that does not support the school’s values. The administration of the school disciplinary action may not be in the sequence prescribed below as the final decision will depend on the situation in which the offence was committed, its nature and its severity.

These corrective measures are used to help students understand both the consequences of their actions and the right values on which their actions should be based. Corrective measures are a form of deterrence and a way to teach students to respect the school, the school staff and their peers. It is student-centric in its aim to help them change for the better.
