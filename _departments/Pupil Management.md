Hougang Secondary School adopts a whole-school holistic approach in managing school discipline with the aim of instilling self-discipline in our pupils. As a community, all Hougeans are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful manner that promotes a conducive environment for learning. Overall, the rules and regulations are designed to create a safe and secure environment for students to learn and teachers to carry out their duties. 

The Pupil Management Department carries out reflection sessions (adapted from the Restorative Approach) with the students to address misbehaviour and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions and come up with solutions. Punishments for offences are accompanied by reflections so that students can understand the rationale for the punishment and learn to be responsible for their own actions.
