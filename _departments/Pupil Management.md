<p>Hougang Secondary School adopts a whole-school holistic approach in managing
school discipline with the aim of instilling self-discipline in our pupils.
As a community, all Hougeans are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful
manner that promotes a conducive environment for learning. Overall, the
rules and regulations are designed to create a safe and secure environment
for students to learn and teachers to carry out their duties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pupil Management Department carries out reflection sessions (adapted
from the Restorative Approach) with the students to address misbehaviour
and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions and come
up with solutions. Consequences for offences are accompanied by reflections
so that students can understand the rationale for the punishment and learn
to be responsible for their own actions.</p>

<p><strong><u>NOTE:</u> Students who have committed any major offence will receive a ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ conduct grade for that semester. Repeated minor offences will also be classified as a major offence. He/she will be given a “Fair” or “Poor” conduct grade which means that he/she will not be eligible for any application of awards, scholarships, bursaries, etc. The offence records will also be updated in the Ministry of Education’s School Cockpit Student Offence Module (SOM).</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES</strong>
</p>
<p>Table 1 below describes the possible consequences which will be applied
to students who exhibit behaviour that does not support the school’s values.
While the sequence/stages of various disciplinary consequences outlined
below in Table 1 serve as a reference point, the administration of the
school disciplinary action and final decision will depend on the situation
in which the offence was committed, its nature and its severity.</p>
<p>In addition to the consequences outlined in Table 1, when applicable,
the school will also implement corrective measures (outlined below in Table
2) to help students understand both the consequences of their actions and
the right values on which their actions should be based on. Corrective
measures are a form of deterrence and a way to teach students to respect
the school, the school staff and their peers. It is student-centric in
its aim to help them change for the better.</p>
