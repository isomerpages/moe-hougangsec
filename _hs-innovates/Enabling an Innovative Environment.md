### HS Innovation Challenge  

HS Innovation Challenge aims to develop our Hougeans into critical thinkers and problem solvers, by allowing them to solve key issues raised in HS Student Voice through the FIDS Innovation Approach. Students with the best ideas are recognised with the ‘HS Young Innovator Award’.   

These innovative ideas are then developed into HS Innovation Initiatives. In 2019-2020, four key initiatives were born; the ‘HS Umbrella-Sharing Initiative’, ‘HS Learning Pods’, ‘HS Cleanathon’ and ‘HS Mentors Initiative’.

### HS Innovation Initiatives

<center> HS Umbrella-Sharing Initiative</center>

The HS Umbrella-Sharing initiative aims to spread kindness and gratitude in HS through the act of sharing umbrellas. 


It was conceived through feedback from the HS Student Voice and through the HS Innovation Challenge, to address the need for umbrellas during rainy days. The idea sprung from two young innovators – Jimmy Tan (3A1 | 2019) and Tricia Kok (4A2 | 2019).

InnoChamps, HS Young Innovators and Student Councillors worked collaboratively to design and materialise this ground-up initiative for the HS Community. More than 80 umbrellas were donated from HS stakeholders, namely students, staff and parents.

<center><b>HS Learning Pod</b></center>

HS Learning Pod initiative aims to provide vibrant learning spaces in HS to enhance school experience for Hougeans. 

  

The idea was conceived by two young innovators - Lew Yee Jiun (1E2 | 2019) and Lim Shi Xuan (2A2 | 2019), through the HS Innovation Challenge. 

  

The first signature pod, placed in the school garden, was dedicated to ‘Class of 2020’ in the spirit of continuous learning. Each year, the graduating cohort contributes to a new pod, to benefit the next generation of Hougeans.

Recognition is consistently provided to encourage Hougeans and staff to develop, improve and be innovative in their area of work.
