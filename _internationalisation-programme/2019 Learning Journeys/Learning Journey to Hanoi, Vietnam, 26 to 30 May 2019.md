A group of 23 students and 4 teachers from Hougang Secondary School embarked on a journey to Hanoi, Vietnam from the 26th to 30th of May. This trip saw our Hougeans making their way through the bustling city of Hanoi as they gained an insight into Vietnam’s cultural heritage and at the same time brought them to Social Protect Centre, an orphanage with beneficiaries aged between 3 and 18, where they interacted with the children with various games and activities.

Their learning objectives include widening their horizons and discovering the world beyond Singapore. In so doing, there will be a better appreciation of their home country. Apart from the aspects of cultural immersion that Hanoi had to offer, the trip also gave them an opportunity for service learning beyond the borders of Singapore. Before the trip, they had to prepare for the games and activities they wanted to do with the children as well as circumvent the inevitable language barrier between them and the Vietnamese. They met up on multiple occasions to discuss the activities they could do with the children and eventually narrowed it down to a few meaningful and engaging ones. During their meetings, they would also try to pronounce Vietnamese words like “xin chao” and “gam un” which mean “hello” and “thank you” respectively.
