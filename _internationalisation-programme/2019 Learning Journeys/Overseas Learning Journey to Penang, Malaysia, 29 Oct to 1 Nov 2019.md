A group of 22 students and 4 teachers from HS Symphonic Band, Angklung and Gamelan CCA set out for a 4D3N trip to Penang, Malaysia, from 29 October to 1 November 2019. This trip, being a musical and cultural immersion programme allowed our Hougeans to gain a better understanding of the different heritages and cultures as well as exposure to music programmes through the school exchange.

Upon arrival at Penang, we set off for a spectacular magic show at Magic World Penang, where we were welcomed by a series of mazes, attractions and mirrors which never failed to catch our attention with their amazing work of magic. After walking down the “museum” showcasing these attractive stations, we sat down to view an exciting and thrilling magic show which gave us a chill down our spines and we were simply amazed with how they managed to get the attention of the crowd and perform flawlessly. We all enjoyed the show. It was definitely an enriching and unforgettable experience.

The next day we began our school exchange at Heng Ee High School. We were warmly received by both the students and teachers there. We also had a chance to explore the school and have a better understanding of the school system in Penang. Members from the HS Symphonic Band had a chance to engage in sectional practice with the students from Heng Ee High School Band and had a combined performance. As for the Angklung and Gamelan CCA, they introduced the Angklung to the students and also carried out an activity to teach the students how to play the Angklung. Overall the students found the exchange an eye opening and a fruitful session.

In the afternoon, we carried out our service learning experience at St John’s Home. Firstly, the HS Symphonic Band performed for the children and conducted an activity where the children at the home had a chance of conducting the band. Secondly, Angklung and Gamelan CCA also carried out a performance and also a hands-on segment where the children learned how to play the hand-held Angklung and play a song together. Lastly, the children participated in a miniature carnival that was carried out and planned by us.

The day before we flew back to Singapore, all of us visited a science museum, Tech Dome Penang, where all of us were able to learn about the human body, science and many more interesting things! Many of us were able to experience the special attractions like The G Force and Rock Climbing at the museum. As part of our Values-In-Action, Mr Ang Ruixiang introduced the “Ovitrap” Project to us. With the guidance of the trainer, we were able to complete building an “Ovitrap”, where the goal of it was to catch mosquitoes and prevent dengue which was a really innovative and thoughtful idea to reduce mosquito breeding in our school. It was a fun and memorable experience at the museum.

To sum up, all of us had a fun and enriching experience in Penang. We enjoyed interacting with our schoolmates and also made new friends through the school exchange. Lastly, we were appreciative that we had the support of our dearest teachers: Mr Ang, Mr Wong, Mrs Raj and Mdm Janisah. Without them, this trip would have not been a successful and memorable one.
