Dear Parents / Guardians,

  

**<u>Internationalisation Programme 2020</u>**

  

At Hougang Secondary School, we believe in educating our students beyond the classrooms. Our students need to be ready for future challenges and overseas learning journey is a good learning platform for students to develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.

  

In 2020, the school will be conducting 7 trips for our Secondary 3 students and these trips will be to countries in Southeast Asia and China during the June and November period (refer to Annex A). Students who have not travelled with the school will be given priority. The school will subsidise 50% of the cost for Singaporean students who have not travelled with the school before to encourage them to participate in these trips. More information on each trip will be given to your child/ward during assembly on 20 January 2020. We hope that as parents/ guardians, you can support your child/ ward in participating in these overseas trips.


Thank you.

Regards

Mr Ari Manickam   
Principal
