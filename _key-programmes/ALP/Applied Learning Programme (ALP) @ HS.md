With the aim of Promoting Effective Communication using Authentic Learning as a Platform, HS Applied Learning Programme has three student learning outcomes:   

1.	Infusing communication skills into the language curriculum.  

2.	Gaining communication skills in both languages (English Language and Mother Tongue Language) via various workshops, to boost their confidence and competencies in connecting with the real world.  

3.	Being given opportunities to lead during assemblies, performances and student-initiated activities to maximise the authentic learning experience.  

All students undergo a three-year Applied Learning Programme, focused on developing the following skills at each level:

 ### ALP English  
 
 **School-wide Reading Programme**  
The Reading Programme in HS is both extensive and intensive, with the former giving students a wide range of reading resources and the latter focusing on rich texts that allow students to go deep in their understanding of a topic or theme. 
With a healthy repertoire of reading resources, the benefits of reading widely are shared with students, and they undergird the Applied Learning Programme by giving our students the content knowledge to understand and apply in authentic platforms.

Aligned with ALP objectives and road map for each level, we chose the engaging, authentic and interactive programmes dedicated to students’ readiness and interests.
 
**Programme overview of 2023:**  

<u>**Secondary One**</u>  
Sec 1 HCL, Express, NA classes: Lyrics Writing Workshop provided students with an unique way to express their ideas, emotions, experiences and to develop creative writing skills as well as using the rhyme of Chinese words through the medium of lyrics writing. After the workshop, students worked in groups to rewrite the lyrics of their favourite song for submission as Alternative Assessment.  

Sec 1 NT classes: Through the Creating Shadow Puppet Character Props and Story Telling Workshop, students were guided by teachers to explore storytelling and character development of the book Journey to the West. This process involves creating narratives, developing characters, and constructing dialogue, all of which are essential elements of creative writing.

‘Script it Right Radio’ Drama Workshop: The Radio Drama Script Writing Workshop was conducted by experienced DJ and instructors from UFM 1003 for Sec 2 students.  Students were introduced to radio drama and how to expand the story based on given scripts and sound.  This helped to prepare them for the ‘Script It Right’ Chinese Radio Drama Competition. Some notable students’ work would be selected to participate in the competition.  

Sec 2 NT classes: The Role Playing Workshop incorporated role-play and Chinese communication within simulated real-life scenario - selling and buying goods in Pasar (market), providing a dynamic platform for students to enhance their self-expression skills.

<u>**Secondary Three**</u>  
Sec 3 HCL, Express classes: In the Stand-up Comedy Workshop, students learned how to write stand-up comedy scripts. Students also watched the performance of the stand-up comedy actor to gain better insights. These were used as a medium to explore and address relevant social issues, values, and other concerns. This approach encouraged students to construct and present well-reasoned arguments, fostering dialectical and critical thinking.   

Sec 3 NA, NT classes: In the Vlog Workshop, students learned how to create and edit Vlog videos. This helped students improved their abilities to express themselves.  More importantly,  the process helped students understand that every coins has two sides and they should always consider different perspectives. Students were empowered to enhance their self-expression capabilities while discovering their unique talents.
