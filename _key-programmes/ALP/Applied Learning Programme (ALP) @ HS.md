<h3>ALP English</h3>
<p><strong>School-wide Reading Programme</strong>
<br>The Reading Programme in HS is both extensive and intensive, with the
former giving students a wide range of reading resources and the latter
focusing on rich texts that allow students to go deep in their understanding
of a topic or theme. With a healthy repertoire of reading resources, the
benefits of reading widely are shared with students, and they undergird
the Applied Learning Programme by giving our students the content knowledge
to understand and apply in authentic platforms.</p>
