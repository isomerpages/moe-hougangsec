1.	Infusing communication skills into the language curriculum  

2.	Gaining communication skills in both languages (EL and MTL) via various workshops, to boost their confidence and competencies in connecting with the real world  

3.	Being given opportunities to lead during assemblies, performances and student-initiated activities to maximise the authentic learning experience.
