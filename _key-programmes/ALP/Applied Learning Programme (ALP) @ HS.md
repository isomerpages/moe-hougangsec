With the aim of Promoting Effective Communication using Authentic Learning as a Platform, HS Applied Learning Programme has three student learning outcomes:  
1.	Infusing communication skills into the language curriculum  

2.	Gaining communication skills in both languages (EL and MTL) via various workshops, to boost their confidence and competencies in connecting with the real world  

3.	Being given opportunities to lead during assemblies, performances and student-initiated activities to maximise the authentic learning experience.  

All students undergo a three-year Applied Learning Programme, focused on developing the following skills at each level:

 School-wide Reading Programme
The Reading Programme in HS is both extensive and intensive, with the former giving students a wide range of reading resources and the latter focusing on rich texts that allow students to go deep in their understanding of a topic or theme. 
With a healthy repertoire of reading resources, the benefits of reading widely are shared with students, and they undergird the Applied Learning Programme by giving our students the content knowledge to understand and apply in authentic platforms.
