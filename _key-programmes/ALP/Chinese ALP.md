Aligned with ALP objectives and road map for each level, we chose the engaging, authentic and interactive programmes dedicated to students’ readiness and interests.
 
**Programme overview of 2023:**  

<u>**Secondary One**</u>  
Sec 1 HCL, Express, NA classes: Lyrics Writing Workshop provided students with an unique way to express their ideas, emotions, experiences and to develop creative writing skills as well as using the rhyme of Chinese words through the medium of lyrics writing. After the workshop, students worked in groups to rewrite the lyrics of their favourite song for submission as Alternative Assessment.  

Sec 1 NT classes: Through the Creating Shadow Puppet Character Props and Story Telling Workshop, students were guided by teachers to explore storytelling and character development of the book Journey to the West. This process involves creating narratives, developing characters, and constructing dialogue, all of which are essential elements of creative writing.

<u>**Secondary Two**</u>    
Sec 2 HCL, Express, NA classes: During the News Interview Workshop, students were engaged to select compelling topics and craft insightful questions for interview. Student interviewers expressed their thoughts clearly and learned to think critically and articulate their ideas effectively.   

‘Script it Right Radio’ Drama Workshop: The Radio Drama Script Writing Workshop was conducted by experienced DJ and instructors from UFM 1003 for Sec 2 students.  Students were introduced to radio drama and how to expand the story based on given scripts and sound.  This helped to prepare them for the ‘Script It Right’ Chinese Radio Drama Competition. Some notable students’ work would be selected to participate in the competition.  

Sec 2 NT classes: The Role Playing Workshop incorporated role-play and Chinese communication within simulated real-life scenario - selling and buying goods in Pasar (market), providing a dynamic platform for students to enhance their self-expression skills.   

Sec 2 Higher Progressed Students Programme: During the Live Hosting Workshop, students were exposed to hosting a live stream. They learned how to hook their audience using proper and engaging words and tone.

<u>**Secondary Three**</u>  
Sec 3 HCL, Express classes: In the Stand-up Comedy Workshop, students learned how to write stand-up comedy scripts. Students also watched the performance of the stand-up comedy actor to gain better insights. These were used as a medium to explore and address relevant social issues, values, and other concerns. This approach encouraged students to construct and present well-reasoned arguments, fostering dialectical and critical thinking.   

Sec 3 NA, NT classes: In the Vlog Workshop, students learned how to create and edit Vlog videos. This helped students improved their abilities to express themselves.  More importantly,  the process helped students understand that every coins has two sides and they should always consider different perspectives. Students were empowered to enhance their self-expression capabilities while discovering their unique talents.
