<p><strong>STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP) -&nbsp; HS Innovates, For Life!</strong>
</p>
<p>Hougang Secondary School's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) HS Innovates,
For Life! takes our existing innovation programme to new heights. Through
this STEM based ALP, we empower students to tackle real-world challenges
through Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), preparing
them for a rapidly evolving future.</p>
<p>Our programme is designed to cultivate 21st Century Competencies (E21CC)
such as adaptive thinking, creativity, and collaboration. By integrating <strong>Design Thinking</strong>,
students gain the tools to approach problems from multiple perspectives,
turning ideas into impactful solutions. With a focus on <strong>technological literacy</strong> and
hands-on experiences, we prepare students to thrive in a tech-driven world.</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Code for Fun (Secondary 1)</strong>
</p>
<p>All Secondary 1 students embark on a thrilling journey to learn the foundations
of coding in a fun and interactive way. Through block-based programming,
they develop essential computational thinking skills and bring their ideas
to life.</p>
<p><strong>Cohort Innovation Programme: Design Thinking (Secondary 1)</strong>
</p>
<p>This signature programme introduces students to the powerful methodology
of Design Thinking. Guided by real-world challenges, they prototype and
test innovative solutions, honing their ability to empathize, ideate, and
implement.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>AI for Fun Programme (Secondary 2)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students take their coding expertise further by exploring
Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This programme
equips them with the skills to design smart solutions, bridging the gap
between software and hardware. Imagine your child creating a home automation
system or designing AI-powered solutions for sustainable living!</p>
<p><strong>Computing as a G3 Subject (Upper Secondary)</strong>
</p>
<p>For those with a passion for technology, we offer Computing as a subject
in Upper Secondary. Students dive deeper into programming, data analytics,
and advanced computational concepts, gaining an edge in the digital economy.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships for Future-Ready Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>HS believes in bridging education with industry relevance. To ensure that
our students gain world-ready knowledge and skills, we work and partner
with institutions such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Science Centre, Singapore</strong> to design customized learning
experiences in STEM for Hougeans. They also help to provide opportunities
for exposure to real-world STEM industries through their Industrial Partnership
Programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nanyang Polytechnic</strong> subject-matter experts who share and
create learning experiences for our students to gain deeper insights into
engineering principles and hands-on applications. They also help to introduce
students to advanced IT concepts and real-world problem-solving in the
digital landscape. Students who demonstrate a passion in STEM will have
a chance to be involved in industry-related projects with Nanyang Polytechnic
students and lecturers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These partnerships enrich our programmes with expert guidance, industry-standard
practices, and exposure to real-world applications, ensuring that our students
are future-ready. We will continue to explore strategic partnerships with
key industries and institutions to provide real-world experiences beyond
school.</p>
<p><strong>Real-World Applications</strong>
</p>
<p>In “HS Innovates, For Life!”, our students don’t just learn—they create.
From solving real-world issues to designing solutions for everyday challenges,
our programmes inspire them to make a meaningful impact on society. We
believe our ALP experiences will help to provide a strong foundation to
prepare Hougeans for tomorrow’s challenges, today. Let’s innovate, for
life!</p>
