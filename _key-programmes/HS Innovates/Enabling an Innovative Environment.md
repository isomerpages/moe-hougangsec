<h3>HS Innovation Challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>HS Innovation Challenge aims to develop our Hougeans into critical thinkers
and problem solvers, by allowing them to solve key issues raised in HS
Student Voice through design thinking. Students with the best ideas are
recognised with the ‘HS Young Innovator Award’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These innovative ideas are then developed into HS Innovation Initiatives.
In 2019-2020, four key initiatives were born; the ‘HS Umbrella-Sharing
Initiative’, ‘HS Learning Pods’, ‘HS Cleanathon’ and ‘HS Mentors Initiative’.</p>

<p>HS Umbrella-Sharing Initiative</p>
<p>The HS Umbrella-Sharing initiative aims to spread kindness and gratitude
in HS through the act of sharing umbrellas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was conceived through feedback from the HS Student Voice and through
the HS Innovation Challenge, to address the need for umbrellas during rainy
days. The idea sprung from two young innovators – Jimmy Tan (3A1/2019)
and Tricia Kok (4A2/2019).</p>
<p>InnoChamps, HS Young Innovators and Student Councillors worked collaboratively
to design and materialise this ground-up initiative for the HS Community.
More than 80 umbrellas were donated from HS stakeholders, namely students,
staff and parents.</p>
<p><strong>HS Learning Pod</strong>
</p>
<p>The idea was conceived by two young innovators - Lew Yee Jiun (1E2/2019)
and Lim Shi Xuan (2A2/2019), through the HS Innovation Challenge.&nbsp;</p>
