### HS Innovation Challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

HS Innovation Challenge aims to develop our Hougeans into critical thinkers and problem solvers, by allowing them to solve key issues raised in HS Student Voice through the FIDS Innovation Approach. Students with the best ideas are recognised with the ‘HS Young Innovator Award’.&nbsp;  

These innovative ideas are then developed into HS Innovation Initiatives. In 2019-2020, four key initiatives were born; the ‘HS Umbrella-Sharing Initiative’, ‘HS Learning Pods’, ‘HS Cleanathon’ and ‘HS Mentors Initiative’.

### HS Innovation Initiatives

The HS Umbrella-Sharing initiative aims to spread kindness and gratitude in HS through the act of sharing umbrellas.&nbsp;


It was conceived through feedback from the HS Student Voice and through the HS Innovation Challenge, to address the need for umbrellas during rainy days. The idea sprung from two young innovators – Jimmy Tan (3A1 | 2019) and Tricia Kok (4A2 | 2019).

InnoChamps, HS Young Innovators and Student Councillors worked collaboratively to design and materialise this ground-up initiative for the HS Community. More than 80 umbrellas were donated from HS stakeholders, namely students, staff and parents.
