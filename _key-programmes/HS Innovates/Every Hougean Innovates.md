### Sec 1 Innovation Cohort Programme and Young Innovators’ Fair

The Sec 1 Innovation Cohort Programme is a 4-day programme, conducted by our Character Coaches for their Secondary One classes, which culminates into the Young Innovators’ Fair.

This programme aims to develop the iterative design thinking process in our Secondary One students based on a common theme - ‘Improving our School Experience’, through the FIDS Innovation Approach. 

During the four days, students collaborate to empathise with the issues in the school environment, brainstorm for ideas collectively, analyse the value-addedness and impact of their ideas, before deciding on a sustainable solution.

At the Young Innovators’ Fair, students showcase and present their best innovative ideas across the whole cohort to learn from each other. Thereafter, they are recognised with the ‘HS Young Innovator Award’.

### InnoVIAtion

In 2019, efforts were being made to strengthen the ‘Values-in-Action’ (VIA) model so as to allow students to focus on their thinking processes and make meaningful contributions to the community. With this in mind, the FIDS Innovation Approach was infused into VIA and hence the ‘InnoVIAtion’ programme was launched.

  

Through this programme, the VIA leaders participated in an experiential training using the&nbsp; InnoVIAtion package, before they begin planning, implementing and reviewing their VIA projects with their CCA members.&nbsp;

  

Students work in groups to understand issues in the community via online research, empathy interviews with organisations and key stakeholders, and environmental observations. They move on to brainstorm on human-centred solutions and present their proposals to their partner organisations. Thereafter, they carry out their VIA projects before finally reflecting on their VIA journey.

### e-Overseas InnoVIAtion 

Due to Covid Pandemic in 2019, many school programmes were affected, including Internationlisation. As such, we expanded the scope of our current programme, InnoVIAtion to e-overseas InnoVIAtion, collaborating with Thailand, India, Philippines, China, Vietnam and Indonesia.
