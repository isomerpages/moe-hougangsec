<h3>Sec 1 Innovation Cohort Programme and Young Innovators’ Fair</h3>
<p><strong>Sec 1 Innovation Cohort Programme and Young Innovators’ Fair</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sec 1 Innovation Cohort Programme is a 4-day programme, conducted
by our Character Coaches for their Secondary One classes, which culminates
into the Young Innovators’ Fair.</p>
<p>This programme aims to develop the iterative design thinking process in
our Secondary One students based on a common theme - ‘Improving our School
Experience’, through the FIDS approach.</p>
<p>During the four days, students collaborate to empathise with the issues
in the school environment, brainstorm for ideas collectively, analyse the
value-addedness and impact of their ideas, before deciding on a sustainable
solution.</p>
<p>At the Young Innovators’ Fair, students showcase and present their best
innovative ideas across the whole cohort to learn from each other. Thereafter,
they are recognised with the ‘HS Young Innovator Award’.</p>

<p>In 2019, efforts were being made to strengthen the ‘Values-in-Action’
(VIA) model so as to allow students to focus on their thinking processes
and make meaningful contributions to the community. With this in mind,
the FIDS Innovation Approach was infused into VIA and hence the ‘InnoVIAtion’
programme was launched.</p>
<p>Through this programme, the VIA leaders participated in an experiential
training using the&nbsp; InnoVIAtion package, before they begin planning,
implementing and reviewing their VIA projects with their CCA members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students work in groups to understand issues in the community via online
research, empathy interviews with organisations and key stakeholders, and
environmental observations. They move on to brainstorm on human-centred
solutions and present their proposals to their partner organisations. Thereafter,
they carry out their VIA projects before finally reflecting on their VIA
journey.</p>

<h3>e-Overseas InnoVIAtion</h3>
<p>Due to Covid Pandemic in 2019, many school programmes were affected, including
Internationlisation. As such, we expanded the scope of our current programme,
InnoVIAtion to e-overseas InnoVIAtion, collaborating with Thailand, India,
Philippines, China, Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>

<p><em>Grand Finale involving all Asia counterparts presenting their innovative solutions to solve global issues</em>
</p>
<p>Through e-overseas InnoVIAtion, each partnering country presented on one
key national issue, in alignment to the UN goals. Through rigorous design
thinking discussions with their global partners, the students cross-pollinated
their ideas, offered alternative perspectives, and sharpened proposed solutions
to edify each other with the best ideas customised for their own national
issues.</p>

<p><em>Hougeans collaborating with Asia counterparts</em>
</p>
<p>An example would be our Singaporean students who identified water scarcity
as a national issue. Inspired by our Filipino counterparts’ sharing about
their own schools’ water filtration system, our students devised their
own water filtration prototype to filter and reuse the rainwater collected
to wash the storage room.</p>
<p>A second example would be the students from India who shared that they
do not have pen refills readily available for them and they find that the
single-used pens contribute significantly to the plastic wastage in their
school. By hearing from our Singaporean students, they considered the use
of a plant-able pen, as well as the possibility of a pen refill dispenser
that allows them to reuse their pens.</p>

<p>Our InnoChamps took part in STEM Playground 2023, organised by Science
Centre and James Dyson Foundation, where the challenge is to construct
a bridge, in a team of 4, with 50 satay sticks, to hold 1 kg of mass. The
InnoChamps conducted their research, communicated their ideas, and collaborated
to make and test their prototypes.</p>
