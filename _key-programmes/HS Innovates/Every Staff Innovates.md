#### InnoNews Portal, MOTD, Challenge the Process, HS Learning Festival

In HS, staff - which include the Teachers and the EAS team, adopts an open and growth mindset where they constantly seek to improve and hone their knowledge, skills and processes. 

Each month, staff register their innovation entries via the InnoNews Portal through the FIDS Innovation Approach. In the spirit of continuous learning, staff also read across other entries, adopt their ideas and practices through the ‘I’m Inspired’ platform in the InnoNews Portal. 

Innovative entries in the portal are assessed monthly by a panel and ‘InnoStars’ are awarded for each entry using a set of FIDS-referenced rubrics. Staff are constantly recognised via the HS ChangeMaker! of the Month award and the HS Star Innovator! of the Year award. 

Selected entries and best practices are presented across many platforms such as ‘Message of the Day (MOTD)’, ‘Challenge the Process’ during staff contact time and ‘HS Learning Festival’. Staff also collaborate actively during presentations by providing their feedback to the presenters to improve further, so as to reach innovation excellence.
