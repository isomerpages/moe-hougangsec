<h3>Challenge the Process</h3>
<p>Our HS staff regularly shares their best innovation practices through
various platforms, such as Challenge the Process during staff contact time,
InnoBuzz – our infographic newsletter showcasing all innovation programmes,
as well as through the HS Learning Festival.</p>

<p><em>InnoBuzz – Infographic Newsletter</em>
</p>
<p>Through these sharing, staff are inspired to adapt and customise various
initiatives into their teaching and learning. We also recognise our staff
for their innovative efforts through the HS Changemakers of the Month and
the HS Star Innovators of the Year Awards.</p>
<p>Every year, we receive 200 – 300 innovation entries in our portal. Our
innovation efforts have also moved towards innovation excellence as we
submit higher quality projects.</p>
