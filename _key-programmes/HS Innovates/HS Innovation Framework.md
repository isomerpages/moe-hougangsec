<p>Innovation is one of HS’s strategic thrust which aims to promote and develop
a growth mindset amongst our students and staff. The tagline of ‘Growing
an Innovative Culture’ guides our school’s innovation efforts to be one
that is systemic, pervasive and continuous, for our students, staff and
school environment. The strategic objectives of ‘Every Hougean Innovates’,
‘Every Staff Innovates’ and ‘Enabling an Innovative Environment’ were established
in line with our stakeholders, to drive our school’s innovation platforms.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>A simple 4-step design thinking process has been adopted as a whole-school
approach to better engage students and staff in the area of innovation.
This process, inspired by Design for Change, is known as the FIDS Innovation
Approach which stands for ‘Feel’, ‘Imagine’, ‘Do’, ‘Share’, that drives
all our innovation processes and platforms. This innovation approach is
underpinned by Deci and Ryan’s ‘Self-Determination Theory’ on the human
needs of competence, relatedness and autonomy to nurture intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Students engage in innovation through the platforms of Innovation Curriculum,
Innovation Cohort Programmes and InnoVIAtion, while staff leverage on key
platforms comprising the Innovation Portal (InnoNews Portal, InnoSpace),
Learning Journey and Learning Festival. The innovation environment in HS
is further enhanced by key platforms impacting both students and staff,
namely Recognition (HS Young Innovators Award, HS ChangeMakers! of the
Month, HS Star Innovators! of the Year and HS Platinum Innovators), Innovation
Sharings (Innovation Speaker Series, MOTD, InnoBuzz and Challenge the Process),
Innovation Challenge and Innovation Initiatives.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of the FIDS Innovation Approach across all innovation
processes and platforms aims to reinforce the school’s overarching outcomes
of ‘Problem Solver’, ‘Socially Apt Person’, ‘Tech Savvy Netizen’, ‘Lifelong
Learner’ and ‘Rooted Citizen’ in our students, and ‘Reflective Practitioner’
in our staff.</p>
