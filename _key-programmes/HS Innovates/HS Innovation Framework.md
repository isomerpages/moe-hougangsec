<p><em>HS Innovates! Growing an Innovative Culture</em>
</p>
<h3>HS Innovation Framework and Approach</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Innovation is one of HS’s strategic thrust which aims to promote and develop
a growth mindset amongst our students and staff. The tagline of ‘Growing
an Innovative Culture’ guides our school’s innovation efforts to be one
that is systemic, pervasive and continuous, for our students, staff and
school environment. The strategic objectives of ‘Every Hougean Innovates’,
‘Every Staff Innovates’ and ‘Enabling an Innovative Environment’ were established
in line with our stakeholders, to drive our school’s innovation platforms.</p>
<p>Students engage in innovation through the platforms of Innovation Curriculum,
Innovation Cohort Programmes and InnoVIAtion, while staff leverage on key
platforms comprising the Innovation Portal (InnoNews Portal, InnoSpace),
Learning Journey and Learning Festival. The innovation environment in HS
is further enhanced by key platforms impacting both students and staff,
namely Recognition (HS Young Innovators Award, HS ChangeMakers! of the
Month, HS Star Innovators! of the Year and HS Platinum Innovators), Innovation
Sharings (Innovation Speaker Series, MOTD, InnoBuzz and Challenge the Process),
Innovation Challenge and Innovation Initiatives.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of design thinking across all innovation processes and
platforms aims to reinforce the school’s overarching outcomes of ‘Problem
Solver’, ‘Socially Apt Person’, ‘Tech Savvy Netizen’, ‘Lifelong Learner’
and ‘Rooted Citizen’ in our students, and ‘Reflective Practitioner’ in
our staff.</p>
