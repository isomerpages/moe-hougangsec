### HS Innovation Framework and Approach

![](/images/hsif.jpeg)

Innovation is one of HS’s strategic thrust which aims to promote and develop a growth mindset amongst our students and staff. The tagline of ‘Growing an Innovative Culture’ guides our school’s innovation efforts to be one that is systemic, pervasive and continuous, for our students, staff and school environment. The strategic objectives of ‘Every Hougean Innovates’, ‘Every Staff Innovates’ and ‘Enabling an Innovative Environment’ were established in line with stakeholders, to drive our school’s innovation platforms.

A simple 4-step design thinking process has been adopted as a whole-school approach to better engage students and staff in the area of innovation. This process is known as the FIDS Innovation Approach, which stands for ‘Feel’, ‘Imagine’, ‘Do’, ‘Share’, that drives all our innovation processes and platforms. This innovation approach is underpinned by Deci and Ryan’s ‘Self-Determination Theory’ on the human needs of competence, relatedness and autonomy to nurture intrinsic motivation.   

  

Students engage in innovation through the platforms of Innovation Curriculum, Innovation Cohort Programmes and InnoVIAtion, while staff leverage on key platforms comprising of the Innovation Portal (InnoNews Portal, InnoSpace), Learning Journey and Learning Festival. The innovation environment in HS is further enhanced by key platforms impacting both students and staff, namely Recognition (HS Young Innovators Award, HS ChangeMakers! of the Month, HS Star Innovators! of the Year and HS Platinum Innovators), Innovation Sharings (Innovation Speaker Series, MOTD, InnoBuzz and Challenge the Process), Innovation Challenge and Innovation Initiatives. 

  

The pervasiveness and rigour of the FIDS Innovation Approach across all innovation processes and platforms aims to reinforce the school’s overarching outcomes of ‘Problem Solver’, ‘Socially Apt Person’, ‘Tech Savvy Netizen’, ‘Lifelong Learner’ and ‘Rooted Citizen’ in our students, and ‘Reflective Practitioner’ in our staff.
