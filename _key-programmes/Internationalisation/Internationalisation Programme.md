At Hougang Secondary School, we believe in educating our students beyond the classrooms. Our students need to be ready for future challenges and overseas learning journey is a good learning platform for students to develop global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.

More information on each trip will be given to your child/ward at a later date. We hope that as parents/ guardians, you can support your child/ward in participating in these overseas trips.
