<h2><strong>STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP) -&nbsp; HS Innovates, For Life!</strong></h2>
<p>Hougang Secondary School's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) HS Innovates,
For Life! takes our existing innovation programme to new heights. Through
this STEM-based ALP, we empower students to tackle real-world challenges
through Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), preparing
them for a rapidly evolving future.</p>
<p>Our programme cultivates 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) such as adaptive
thinking, creativity, and collaboration. By integrating <strong>Design Thinking</strong>,
students gain tools to approach problems from multiple perspectives, turning
ideas into impactful solutions. With a focus on technological literacy
and hands-on experiences, we prepare students to thrive in a tech-driven
world and become innovators who improve people's lives.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Code for Fun (Secondary 1)</strong>
</p>
<p>All Secondary 1 students embark on a thrilling journey to learn the foundations
of coding in a fun and interactive way. Through block-based programming,
they develop essential computational thinking skills and bring their ideas
to life.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation Cohort Programme: Design Thinking (Secondary 1)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our signature Secondary 1 programme introduces students to the powerful
methodology of design thinking. Students learn the complete design thinking
process—empathising with users, defining problems, ideating creative solutions,
prototyping, and testing—through authentic, real-world challenges. This
foundational introduction enables students to develop innovative solutions
and build critical problem-solving skills and collaborative teamwork abilities
through project-based learning. Students will continue to apply and develop
these design thinking capabilities throughout their entire journey at HS.</p>
<p>The programme culminates in the prestigious Young Innovators' Fair, where
outstanding groups showcase their design thinking solutions and receive
gold, silver, or bronze recognition. This introductory programme kickstarts
students' journey in becoming resilient innovators, preparing them to tackle
tomorrow's challenges with confidence through design thinking methodology.</p>

<p><strong>AI for Fun Programme (Secondary 2)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students take their coding expertise further by exploring
Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This programme
equips them with the skills to design smart solutions, bridging the gap
between software and hardware. Imagine your child creating a home automation
system or designing AI-powered solutions for sustainable living!</p>

<p><strong>Computing (Upper Secondary)</strong>
</p>
<p>For those with a passion for technology, we offer Computing as a subject
in Upper Secondary. Students dive deeper into programming, data analytics,
and advanced computational concepts, gaining an edge in the digital economy.</p>
<h3><strong>STEM Leaders</strong></h3>
<p><strong>STEM Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Our curated STEM Programmes provide our STEM Leaders with diverse opportunities
to participate, engage, and gain exposure to cutting-edge STEM initiatives.
These programmes develop students' critical thinking, problem-solving abilities,
and innovation skills while fostering curiosity and passion for STEM. This
prepares them to be future-ready learners who can contribute meaningfully
to Singapore's innovation landscape.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>STEM Playground Challenge</strong>: Our STEM Leaders participate
in this annual challenge organised by Science Centre, James Dyson Foundation
and MOE, tackling engineering problems such as "How Far Reel It Move" (2024),
and "A Ph-antom Ship" (2025).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DiscovHER</strong>: Female STEM Leaders participate in this Science
event promoting STEM education among girls and inspiring STEM career pursuits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Youth Fest @ Ci Yuan CC (2025):</strong> STEM Leaders showcased
a booth where community members customised salad kits using fresh greens
from our school's autopots system, sharing their sustainable farming knowledge
with the broader community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Singapore Youth Science Festival (2025)</strong>: Five Science
students developed flood mitigation solutions using strategic plant placement,
while five STEM Leaders created natural dyes from fruit peels, addressing
food waste and promoting sustainable textile production.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sustainability (Hydroponics and Autopots)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Sustainability Programme develops our STEM Leaders as environmental
stewards through hands-on sustainable farming. Starting in 2025, students
manage the complete hydroponics cycle from seeding to harvesting, learning
valuable life skills and environmental awareness. Through a three-month
collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), students master
Autopots technology while exploring critical food waste issues, connecting
their learning to real-world environmental challenges.</p>
<p>Students share their fresh produce during major school events including
Staff Appreciation, Sports Carnival, and Jubilee Homecoming, creating meaningful
connections between their learning and the school community. At Youth Fest
2025, students educated the broader community about urban farming through
customised salad kits using their harvest, developing confidence and communication
skills while promoting sustainable practices.</p>
<p>The programme nurtures community builders who develop environmental stewardship
values, responsibility, and social-emotional competencies through collaborative
farming, community outreach, and peer education—preparing them to be thoughtful,
engaged citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Community Innovation Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2024, HS collaborated with the Design Singapore Council (DSG) and Bold@Work,
bringing together 50 selected Secondary 2 and 3 students from STEM Leaders,
VIA Leaders, and Young Innovators to tackle real community challenges.
Bold@Work facilitated the programme while our teachers mentored student
groups as students created innovative solutions addressing genuine health-related
needs in the neighbourhood around our school.</p>
<p>Over 7 months, students interacted with community stakeholders, discovering
real problems and co-creating meaningful solutions through a scaffolded
design thinking process. Through hands-on discovery, experimentation, and
creation, students developed essential competencies including empathy,
collaboration, creative confidence, and experimentation mindsets.</p>
<p>The programme concluded with a final showcase where students presented
their innovations to beneficiaries, stakeholders, parents, teachers, and
fellow schoolmates. This initiative nurtured empowered leaders who gained
confidence in addressing real-world challenges and making meaningful community
impact through collaborative innovation.</p>
<h3><strong>Partnerships for Future-Ready Learning</strong></h3>
<p>HS believes in bridging education with industry relevance. To ensure that
our students gain world-ready knowledge and skills, we work and partner
with institutions such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Science Centre, Singapore</strong>&nbsp;to design customized learning
experiences in STEM for Hougeans. They also help to provide opportunities
for exposure to real-world STEM industries through their Industrial Partnership
Programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>&nbsp;subject-matter experts who share
and create learning experiences for our students to gain deeper insight
into engineering principles and hands-on applications. They also help to
introduce students to advanced IT concepts and real-world problem-solving
in the digital landscape. Students who demonstrate a passion in STEM will
have a chance to be involved in industry-related projects with Nanyang
Polytechnic students and lecturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Singapore Council </strong>facilitates collaborations with
organisations like The Common Bench (2025) and Bold@Work (2024) through
their “Learning by Design: Design Thinking in Schools” programme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These partnerships enrich our programmes with expert guidance, industry-standard
practices, and real-world applications, ensuring that our students are
future-ready.</p>
<h3><strong>Real-World Applications</strong></h3>
<p>In “HS Innovates, For Life!”, our students don’t just learn—they create.
From solving real-world issues to designing solutions for everyday challenges,
our programmes inspire them to make a meaningful impact on society. We
believe our ALP experiences will help to provide a strong foundation to
prepare Hougeans for tomorrow’s challenges, today. Let’s innovate, for
life!</p>
