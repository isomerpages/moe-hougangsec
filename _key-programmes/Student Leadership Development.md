Hougang Secondary School's Student Leadership Team aims to develop leadership skills in every student and envisions "Every Hougean a Principled Leader." The team's mission is "To Nurture the Leadership Potential in Every Hougean," and the school accomplishes this through a comprehensive student leadership programme built on the 3E Approach  â€“ Engaging Hands, Enriching Minds, Encouraging Hearts. The programme is aligned with the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) 2021 Framework in Singapore, which emphasizes the development of leadership skills and values namely, care,  respect, responsibility, resilience, and integrity (Ministry of Education Singapore, 2021).

### Engaging Hands - Provide Opportunities
Our HS Student Leadership Development programme incorporates the work of Dweck (2006) on mindset and the belief that every child has the potential to be a leader with the right environment and circumstances. As such, the school adopts a tiered approach to provide leadership opportunities for all students.
