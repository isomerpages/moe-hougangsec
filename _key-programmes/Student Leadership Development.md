<p>Hougang Secondary School's Student Leadership Team aims to develop leadership
skills in every student and envisions "Every Hougean an Empowered Leader."
The team's mission is "To Nurture the Leadership Potential in Every Hougean,"
and the school accomplishes this through a comprehensive student leadership
programme built on the 3E Approach – Engaging Hands, Enriching Minds, Encouraging
Hearts. The programme is aligned with the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) 2021 Framework in Singapore, which emphasizes the development of
leadership skills and values namely, care, respect, responsibility, resilience,
and integrity (Ministry of Education Singapore, 2021).</p>
<h3>Engaging Hands - Provide Opportunities</h3>
<p>Our HS Student Leadership Development programme incorporates the work
of Dweck (2006) on mindset and the belief that <strong>every child</strong> has
the potential to be a leader with the right environment and circumstances.
As such, the school adopts a tiered approach to <strong>provide leadership opportunities for all students</strong>.</p>

<p>At Tier 1, all students undergo the Community Youth Leadership programme,
which focuses on developing self-leadership skills and aims to equip every
student with the tools to lead themselves effectively. The signature CYL
programme is also a key components of our school’s Learning For Life Programme
(LLP).</p>

</p>
<p>At Tier 2, students can take on leadership roles in their respective class
committees, CCA committees, and VIA (Values-In-Action) leadership positions.
By taking on these roles, students can develop and refine their leadership
abilities, enabling them to make a positive impact on their classmates
and CCA members beyond their individual selves.</p>
<p>At Tier 3, selected students are given the opportunity to lead the school
as Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Class Monitors, or CCA Leaders.
These positions require a higher level of leadership skills and provide
students with more significant responsibilities and opportunities to impact
their school community and beyond.</p>
<h3>Enriching Minds - Cultivate Competencies</h3>
<p>The school's leadership programme is grounded in the philosophy that <strong>leadership can be learned, nurtured, and developed over time</strong>,
which is consistent with the work of Kouzes and Posner (2002) and their
Leadership Challenge Model (LCM). The programme focuses on the importance
of behaviors and values, with a specific focus on five key practices: modeling
the way, inspiring a shared vision, challenging the process, enabling others
to act, and encouraging the heart. By emphasizing these practices, the
programme seeks to cultivate leadership skills in all students.</p>

<h3>Encouraging Hearts - Inspire Excellence</h3>
<p>Hougang Secondary implements a two-pronged approach to encourage the hearts
of student leaders and inspire excellence in them.</p>
<p>The first prong is reflection, which is designed to help student leaders
review the programmes they have organised and identify areas for improvement.
To do this, students use the "What? So What? Now What?" reflection model
(Gibbs, 1988), which is a structured way of reflecting on experiences and
learning from them.</p>

<p>The second prong of the approach is affirmation, which involves recognising
and celebrating the achievements of student leaders. This happens at two
key events during the school year. The first is the Student Leaders Investiture,
where new leaders are recognised and given their badges. This event is
an opportunity to celebrate the commitment and dedication of student leaders
and to inspire them to continue to serve their school community. The second
event is the year-end Summit, where student leaders come together to reflect
on their experiences over the year, celebrate their successes, and set
new goals for the future.</p>
