Hougang Secondary School's Student Leadership Team aims to develop leadership skills in every student and envisions "Every Hougean a Principled Leader." The team's mission is "To Nurture the Leadership Potential in Every Hougean," and the school accomplishes this through a comprehensive student leadership programme built on the 3E Approach  – Engaging Hands, Enriching Minds, Encouraging Hearts. The programme is aligned with the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) 2021 Framework in Singapore, which emphasizes the development of leadership skills and values namely, care,  respect, responsibility, resilience, and integrity (Ministry of Education Singapore, 2021).

### Engaging Hands - Provide Opportunities
Our HS Student Leadership Development programme incorporates the work of Dweck (2006) on mindset and the belief that **every child** has the potential to be a leader with the right environment and circumstances. As such, the school adopts a tiered approach to **provide leadership opportunities for all students**.

At Tier 1, all students undergo the Community Youth Leadership programme, which focuses on developing self-leadership skills and aims to equip every student with the tools to lead themselves effectively. The signature CYL programme is also a key components of our school’s Learning For Life Programme (LLP).

At Tier 2, students can take on leadership roles in their respective class committees, CCA committees, and VIA (Values-In-Action) leadership positions. By taking on these roles, students can develop and refine their leadership abilities, enabling them to make a positive impact on their classmates and CCA members beyond their individual selves.

At Tier 3, selected students are given the opportunity to lead the school as Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Class Monitors, or CCA Leaders. These positions require a higher level of leadership skills and provide students with more significant responsibilities and opportunities to impact their school community  and beyond.

### Enriching Minds - Cultivate Competencies

The school's leadership programme is grounded in the philosophy that **leadership can be learned, nurtured, and developed over time**, which is consistent with the work of Kouzes and Posner (2002) and their Leadership Challenge Model (LCM). The programme focuses on the importance of behaviors and values, with a specific focus on five key practices: modeling the way, inspiring a shared vision, challenging the process, enabling others to act, and encouraging the heart. By emphasizing these practices, the programme seeks to cultivate leadership skills in all students.
