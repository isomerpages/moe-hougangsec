Dear Parents/Guardians,
  

The Land Transport Authority (LTA), Traffic Police (TP) and Hougang Secondary School have received feedback that vehicles have not been adhering to the ‘No Right’ turn sign outside the school gate between 6.45 am and 7.30 am. This has resulted in a long tail back of vehicles queue inside the school compound.

2\. For the safety of the general public and to ensure smooth flow of vehicles in/out of the school premises, we encourage all motorists to make a left turn into Hougang St 93 only when you leave the school premises between 6.45 am and 7.30 am.  

3\. We will be placing traffic cones within the school premises to guide motorists to make the left turn with effect from 23rd March 2021

4\. LTA and TP will not hesitate to take enforcement actions against motorists who violates traffic rules and regulations.

5\. Thank you for your co-operation.

Regards,   
Mr Brandon Lee  
Principal, Hougang Secondary School
