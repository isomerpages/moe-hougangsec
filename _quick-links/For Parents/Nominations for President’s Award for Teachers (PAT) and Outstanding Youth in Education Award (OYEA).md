The President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) recognises excellent and experienced educators who are role models for the teaching profession. These educators constantly adopt innovative approaches in their lessons, and are lifelong learners and mentors to their peers. They personify deep passion for teaching, and inspire their students and peers through words and deeds.

The PAT is open to teachers from primary schools, secondary schools, Junior Colleges (JC)/Millennia Institute (MI), as well as educators from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), polytechnics and the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC).
