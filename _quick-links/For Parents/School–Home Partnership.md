Dear Parents,

The Ministry of Education (MOE) has released a set of guidelines on the development of positive school-home partnerships. Positive and meaningful school-home partnerships will help to ensure that our students get the most benefit from these changes. MOE has thus developed a set of Guidelines for School-Home Partnership, in consultation with schools and parents, to provide greater clarity on how schools and parents can work together.   

The central feature of the guidelines is how schools and parents can work hand-in-hand so that our students develop self-management skills, take responsibility as well as ownership of their learning, and build resilience. This partnership is most effective when founded on mutual respect and trust. Our students do best when parents and the school work hand-in-hand to support them. 

We hope these guidelines on school-home partnership will be a useful reference for all to help our students have ownership over their learning, develop a sense of purpose and succeed in life.

MOE has also provided the guides which may be useful to you below.
