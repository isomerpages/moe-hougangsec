<p><strong>Q: What is the criteria for a Sec 2 student to be promoted to Sec 3?</strong>

<p><strong>Q: What is considered in the allocation of subject combinations?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The allocation of subject combinations will be based on merit, choice
and vacancy.</p>
<p>If there is a high demand for a particular subject combination, choice
order and overall grades for the subject will be the deciding factors.
E.g., if a student chooses Combined Science (Chemistry/Biology) as his/her
first choice, the school will rank all students who opted for Combined
Science (Chemistry/Biology) based on their overall results for Lower Sec
Science, to the point where all the vacancies are filled up. This applies
to the coursework subjects as well.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the maximum and minimum number of subjects that students from Express, N(A) and N(T) can offer? Is it possible to drop any subjects after subject allocation has been confirmed?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Express students in our school typically take 7 subjects and students
in N(A)/N(T) stream are offered 6 subjects. Students need a minimum of
6 subjects to be registered for the national examinations for Express stream
and 5 subjects for the Normal stream.</p>
<p>Students are to consult their subject teachers and ECG Counsellor before
they consider dropping any subject, as it may have an impact on his/her

<p><strong>Q: How can students qualify to take up Out-of-stream Subjects (OSS) at Sec 3?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: At Sec 3, students may take/continue a subject at a more demanding
level (Out-of-Stream Subject or OSS, for short) if they meet the following
criteria: -</p>
<p>* For Sec 2 N(A) students who are currently not taking any SBB (Subject-based
Banding) subjects, they are eligible to take up OSS subjects (i.e. at the
Express level) if they meet the school-based criteria of 75% or better
for the subject;</p>
<p>* For Sec 2 N(A) students who are already taking an SBB subject, they
would need to score 50% or better for the SBB subject in order to be eligible
to continue taking the subject as an OSS subject (i.e. at the Express level)
in Sec 3;</p>
<p>* For Sec 2 N(T) students who are already taking an SBB subject, they
would need to score 60% or better for the SBB subject in order to be eligible
to continue taking the subject as an OSS subject [i.e. at the N(A) level]
in Sec 3.</p>
<p>* For 2N(T) students who are currently not taking any SBB subjects, they
need to score 75% or better for the subject in order to be eligible to
take it as an OSS subject [i.e. at the N(A) level] in Sec 3.</p>
<p>Students can take up a maximum of 3 OSS subjects. However, taking OSS
subjects does not qualify students to be promoted to a more demanding stream.
Students need to meet the promotion criteria for lateral transfer to a
more demanding stream.</p>
<p>For Sec 2 N(A), students who meet the promotion criteria and obtain 70%
or more in the overall percentage of all subjects combined may be laterally
transferred to Sec 3 Express.</p>
<p>For Sec 2 N(T), students who meet the promotion criteria, obtain 70% or
more in the overall percentage of all subjects combined may be laterally
transferred to Sec 2N(A).</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will the school consider opening 2 classes of Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) or Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) for each stream if there is demand?</strong>
</p>

as safety requirements and availability of school resources. Based on current

<p><strong>Q: What are coursework subjects?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: A coursework subject involves working on a performance task such as
a rigorous research paper or design/art project. Students are required
to analyse, think critically, plan and carry out comprehensive, thorough
research in which they ask questions, examine issues, gather, record, collate,
interpret and evaluate data to complete a working Artefact, Design Journal,
Presentation Boards, Artwork and/or Research Paper.</p>
<p>National examinations for the coursework subject consist of two papers
(Paper 1 and Paper 2). Students are expected to attempt a performance task
examination (design project/final artwork/research paper) and a written
examination.</p>
<p>The examination question paper for the performance task will be issued
in January of the national examination year. Students are expected to work
on their coursework during scheduled sessions in school after curriculum
time. Coursework students are required to work independently and adhere
to the scheduled submission timeline under the supervision of the subject
teacher. The written paper will be done in a single seating with the rest
of the national examination subjects at the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can students offer Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL) in Upper Secondary?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Higher Mother Tongue Language is typically offered from Sec 1, to provide
students with sufficient runway to learn and do well. Students who do not
take HMTL in Lower Sec but are interested in taking HMTL starting from
Sec 3 are advised to consult their subject teachers and they may be considered
on a case-by-case basis. However, as we do not offer Higher Malay Language
(HML) or Higher Tamil Language (HTL) in-school, students will have to attend
these lessons in external centres.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can a student opt for Mother Tongue Language ‘B’ (MTL ‘B’) in Upper Secondary?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Currently, the school does not offer MTL ‘B’ for Sec 1 to 3 students,
and students have to go to external centres for MTL ‘B’ lessons. As the
lesson timings are decided by these external centres, there may be clashes
with some of our school programmes. Students are strongly encouraged students
to try out MTL for 3 years before deciding on taking MTL ‘B’.</p>
<p><u>CL ‘B’</u>
</p>
<p>Students who have difficulties coping with CL since Lower Sec will be
identified and given the option to do CL ‘B’ in Secondary 4. Students who
are not identified but would like to take CL ‘B’ in Secondary 4 will be
considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><u>ML ‘B’ or TL ‘B’</u>

<p><strong>Q: Can students drop MTL as a subject in Upper Secondary?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Students may be eligible for MTL exemption in a mainstream secondary
school if they:</p>
<p>* Are returning from overseas and had no opportunity to learn an official
MTL, a Non-Tamil Indian Language (NTIL) or an approved Foreign Language
or Asian Language for a sustained period of time.</p>
<p>* Have special educational needs, with severe difficulties in coping with
overall learning.</p>
<p>The school needs to request approval from HQ for dropping MTL and such
requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by HQ</p>
<p>Other than the above, students are required to take MTL or MTL ‘B’ for
their National Examinations.</p>
