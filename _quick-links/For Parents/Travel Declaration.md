Dear Parent/Guardian,  

  

1\. To ensure that schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make a travel declaration for your child/ward if he/she will be travelling for the holidays by 17 Nov 2022 (Thursday).

  

2\. We encourage you to do so via the Parents’ Gateway (PG) app (refer to [https://pg.moe.edu.sg](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/)). If you do not have access to Parents’ Gateway (PG), you may do so by using the hardcopy form [here](/files/HS-2022-166%20Hardcopy%20Letter%20to%20Parents%20and%20Guardians%20Not%20Using%20PG.pdf).

  

3\. If your child/ward is travelling, please indicate clearly both the country and city of travel. Only one parent is required to make the declaration.

  

4\. If your child/ward is not travelling during the holidays, no action is required.

  

5\. When planning your child/ward’s travel, please refer to [https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart) for more information and updates. If there is a change of travel plan(s) after declaration, please inform the school as soon as possible.

  

6\. Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.
