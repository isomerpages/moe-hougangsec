<p>In this digital age, the availability of screen devices and their uses
for learning and social interaction have rapidly expanded over recent years.
At the moment, there is limited evidence of what constitutes a safe time
limit for screen use. Instead, parental supervision and collaborating with
children to adopt healthy screen habits helps to prevent uncontrolled,
excessive and unhealthy screen practices. The key lies in achieving balance.
It is also necessary to draw up agreement with your child on the maximum
daily screen time for recreational use. We include this advisory on screen
use provided by MOH for your reference.&nbsp; (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/resources-statistics/guidelines/for-upload-guidance-on-screen-use-in-children-17-aug-2023.pdf</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will continue to guide our students on managing their learning and
recreation activities on their PLDs, and remind them to have sufficient
sleep, eat healthily and exercise regularly to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>(1) How does the school select students for the internationalisation programme?</p>
<p>(2) Can the school provide the tentative travel dates of the trips?</p>

<p>This year, we have scheduled three overseas trips. The Cambodia and Vietnam
trips are planned for the end of semester 1, and the Thailand trip is scheduled
for the end of semester 2. The <strong>tentative</strong> dates for the various
trips are:</p>
<p>Vietnam – 25 May to 29 May 2024</p>
<p>Cambodia – 25 May to 29 May 2024</p>
<p>Thailand – 26 Oct to 30 Oct 2024</p>
<p>30 Secondary 3 students will travel to Cambodia, and another 30 Secondary
3 students will travel to Vietnam. The trip to Thailand is intended as
a sports development trip. Therefore, it is organised for Secondary 3 and
Secondary 2 students who hold positions as Sports Leaders or CCA Leaders,
or who are members in sports CCAs. 30 students will be chosen for this
trip.</p>
<p>We will conduct briefings to the relevant cohort of students for the trips
to share with them details of the internationalisation programme. Information
about the trip will also be shared with parents through PG, to allow parents
to engage in discussions with your child.&nbsp;After the briefing, an online
application form will be shared. Interested students will need to seek
approval from parents and complete the online application form. Through
this process, students will express their interest and share their motivations
for the trip. The class Character Coaches, Subject teachers/ CCA teachers,
Year Heads will review each application. Factors such as the student’s
motivation for the trip, enthusiasm for learning and diversity will be
considered. Once the selection process is complete, all applicants will
be notified of the outcome through the student’s ICON email.</p>
<p>Parents will co-pay 50% of the trip and/ or programme cost to emphasise
their responsibility for and commitment to their children’s participation
in internationalisation while schools will subsidise the remaining 50%.
Parents can choose to tap on your child’s existing Edusave funds for the
trip. If there are insufficient funds in the Edusave account, the balance
can be paid using cash.</p>
<p>For students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, parents will co-pay
20% while the school will provide a subsidy of 80%.</p>
<p>Singapore PR / International Students will have to pay 100% of the trip/
programme cost.</p>

to get students to work on the ten-year-series. The subject teachers will
advise students when to buy the ten-year-series and will use the GCE O/N-Level
questions for lesson discussion, for practice and for homework, over the
two years in Secondary 3 and 4.</p>

<p>One of the four key messages of Sexuality Education is “Build positive
relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong
families)”. Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner. In Secondary
three, the focus is on Respectful Relationships &amp; Safety and the impact
of BGR is discussed during the lessons. For more information on the lessons,
