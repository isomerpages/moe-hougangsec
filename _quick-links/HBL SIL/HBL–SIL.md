#### Home-Based Learning and Student-Initiated Learning (HBL-SIL)


Home-Based Learning (HBL) on every even Wednesday, will commence from Term 1 Week 2 (12 January) onwards for all levels. HBL will be in the form of asynchronous learning. Your child/ward will learn based on their own schedule by accessing and completing lessons prepared by his/her subject teachers. Students who need a more conducive environment to learn are requested to inform their Character Coaches. Arrangements will be made for these students to return to school on HBL Days.  

On HBL days, an hour is set aside for your child/ward for Student-Initiated Learning (SIL). Students are to use this time to explore an area of interest by initiating learning activities on their own. For example, students can try out hands-on activities on topics that they are passionate about, such as tinkering, baking or playing a musical instrument.

1\.        **General Instructions.** Assignments are based on the timetable for HBL Wednesday. While there is no morning attendance-taking, students are encouraged to start the day early and complete their assigned tasks before 5 pm. Please refer to the links below for the schedule and subject-specific instructions. The instructions (I), Estimated Time on Computer (ECT) and Homework (HW) (where applicable) will be indicated clearly in the schedule. The HBL briefing slides can also be found [here](/files/HBL%20Briefing%20to%20Students.pdf).
