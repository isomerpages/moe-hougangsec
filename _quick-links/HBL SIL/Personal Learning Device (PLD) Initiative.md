At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. This provides important information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.  
  

#### Personal Learning Device (PLD) for Secondary School Students

2\.    **Overview.** 

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.  

  

3\.    **Purchase of PLD bundle.** 

The school has made arrangements for you to purchase the PLD from ASIAPAC TECHNOLOGY PTE. LTD. (Vendor) for your child’s/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of the device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase by your child/ward will be the Enhanced Device Bundle comprising the following : 
*   Apple iPad \[10.2” 9th Gen model, 3GB RAM, 64 GB Storage\] 
*   Apple Pencil 
*   Ruggedized Keyboard Combo 3 Case 
*   3 Year AppleCare+
*   3 Year Insurance

The price of the Enhanced Device Bundle stated in the letter is inclusive of GST. 

The Enhanced Device Bundle includes the device, associated accessories, insurance, warranty, and fortnightly courier service by Contractor to collect damaged devices from school _(Or parents can choose to send directly to the 6 Apple Service Centres)_

  

4\. **Use of Edusave.** 

MOE has provided Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020, and in May 2021 to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary students. Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD.  

  

5\.  **Financial Assistance.** 

Subsidies are available for students who require financial assistance to purchase a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted.

“**PCI**” refers to the Gross Household Income divided by the total number of family members in the household.

**Software Applications**  

6\.  **IT Applications.** Schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital for students’ teaching and learning. These include:

* (a) **Student iCON**: Every secondary school student will be provided with access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email address.
* (b) **Microsoft ProPlus**: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.
* (c) **Zoom**: Every secondary school student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 min time limit for their video conferencing needs.

The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s full name, Student iCON ID and class to set up user accounts. The school may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above.

**7\. Device Management Application.** 

A Device Management Application (“**DMA**”) will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on all student-owned devices subject to parental/guardian consent. The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:
* (a) Classroom Management Service. This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.
* (b) Mobile Device Management Service. This facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.
* (c) Usage Management Service. This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.

The DMA has a variety of functions that will support the use of the PLD in the classroom, as well as safeguard students’ cyber-wellness. Please refer to our school website for more information on the DMA, as well as how parents may play an active role through the use of the DMA to monitor your child’s well-being.  

  

8\. **Cyber-wellness.** 

In rolling out the PLD, MOE is acutely aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA allows the school to manage this, by
* (a) collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application,
* (b) monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student, and
* (c) placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent cyber addiction.

Please refer to Annexes A, B and C for more details on the functions and features of the DMA, and on the collection and protection of personal data. 

9\. **Upcoming activities**. Billing and payment for the PLD will commence in February and the delivery of the PLD is expected to be in Term 2. The projected timeline for the key activities is shown below:

#### Next Steps

10\.  To proceed with the purchase of the PLD, please submit the online forms (see table 2) by **5 January 2022**. The online forms will be available after Sec 1 registration. If you are unable to submit the form online, please contact the school for a hardcopy version.
