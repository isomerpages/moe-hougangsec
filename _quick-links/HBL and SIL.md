<h4>Home-Based Learning and Student-Initiated Learning (HBL-SIL)</h4>
<p>In 2025, the Home-Based Learning (HBL) schedule is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Term 1</strong>
</p>
<p>03 February, Monday (Secondary 4 and 5 only)</p>
<p>20 February, Thursday</p>
<p>03 March, Monday</p>
<p><strong>Term 2</strong>
</p>
<p>26 March, Wednesday</p>
<p>10 April, Thursday</p>
<p>23 April, Wednesday</p>
<p>05 May, Monday</p>
<p>21 May, Wednesday</p>
<p><strong>Term 3 (Sec 1, 2 and 3 only)</strong>
</p>
<p>15 ( Tuesday), 16 (Wednesday), 17 July (Thursday)</p>
<p>28 July, Monday</p>
<p>HBL will be in the form of asynchronous learning. Your child/ward will
learn based on their own schedule by accessing and completing lessons prepared
by his/her subject teachers. Students who need a more conducive environment
to learn are requested to inform their Character Coaches. Arrangements
will be made for these students to return to school on HBL Days.</p>
<p>On HBL days, an hour is set aside for your child/ward for Student-Initiated
Learning (SIL). Students are to use this time to explore an area of interest
by&nbsp;initiating learning activities on their own. For example, students
can try out hands-on activities on topics that they are passionate about,
such as tinkering, baking or playing a musical instrument.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>General Instructions.</strong>&nbsp;Assignments
are based on the timetable for HBL Wednesday. While there is no morning
attendance-taking, students are encouraged to start the day early and complete
their assigned tasks before 5 pm. Please refer to the links below for the
schedule and subject-specific instructions.&nbsp;The instructions (I),
Estimated Time on Computer (ECT) and Homework (HW) (where applicable) will
be indicated clearly in the schedule.</p>
