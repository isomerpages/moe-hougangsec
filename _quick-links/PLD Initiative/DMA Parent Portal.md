From 18 Oct 2021, the DMA Parent Portal will be available to you to monitor your child’s/ward’s PLD activities. You will be receiving an activation e-mail via the e-mail address that you had previously provided to the school. If the activation e-mail is not found in your Inbox, please check the ‘Junk Folder’ or ‘Spam Folder’ for the e-mail notification. Should you still not be able to onboard the DMA parent portal by 22 Oct, please contact school’s ICT Helpdesk at 63726668 ext 260 or 261  
  
Only applications that are whitelisted are accessible during school hours. The table below summarises the key differences amongst the various options. Please submit this [form https:go.gov.sg/hs-ict-helpdesk](https://go.gov.sg/hs-ict-helpdesk) if you wish to change your child's existing DMA option to the one that suits him/her.

HS instils in our students the importance of self-regulation and trustworthiness towards the use of the PLD. We thank parents for working with the school to promote a growth mindset in our children. Should you have other encouraging stories to share with us, or concerns relating to the cyber well-being of your child, do write to us (hougang\_ss@moe.edu.sg). You may also reach out through your child’s character coaches.

  

Thank you!
