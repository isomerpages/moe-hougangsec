#### Data Protection

1\. **How will my child’s/ward’s data be used in the PLD and IT Applications?** 

**DMA.** The Device Management Application (DMA) which will be installed in your child's/ward’s PLD collects data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application. The DMA data will only be used for MOE’s cyber-wellness measures and technical troubleshooting. MOE will not disclose the data to any person otherwise than permitted under the law.

**IT Applications.** For the IT Applications (student iCON and Microsoft ProPlus), the school will use your child’s/ward’s personal data such as his/her name, birth certificate number and class to set up user accounts. This data will also be used for the purposes of authenticating and verifying user identity, troubleshooting and facilitating system improvements. In addition, the commercial providers of these platforms (e.g. Google, Microsoft) will collect and deal with user data generated by your child’s/ward’s use of these applications. The collection use and disclosure of such data are governed by the commercial provider’s terms of use, which can be found here:

• Microsoft Pro Plus: [https://portal.office.com/commerce/mosa.aspx](https://portal.office.com/commerce/mosa.aspx)  
  

2\. **Where will the data collected by DMA and IT Applications for NDLP be stored?** 

All user data which is collected by MOE will be stored in secure servers managed by the respective vendors of our systems. The Government has put in place strong personal data protection laws and policies to safeguard sensitive data collected by public agencies such as MOE. Please refer to this website for more information on these laws and policies: [https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/why-Smart-Nation/secure-smart-nation/personal-data-protection](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/why-Smart-Nation/secure-smart-nation/personal-data-protection)
