<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD) by end-2021. This provides important information about how
you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying
applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.</p>
<h4>Personal Learning Device (PLD) for Secondary School Students</h4>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Overview.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –
the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also
enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they
navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p>
<p><strong>For newly posted in students at Secondary 1</strong>, parents
will need to ensure that the following are submitted before Tuesday, 31
December 2024, 12 pm.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://go.gov.sg/edusaveformsgso" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Intent to purchase and use of Edusave</a>&nbsp;(requires

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Purchase of PLD bundle.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school has made arrangements for you to purchase the PLD from&nbsp;ASIAPAC
TECHNOLOGY PTE. LTD.&nbsp;(Vendor) for your child’s/ward’s use in school.
The vendor has been identified based on the choice of the device determined
by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The
PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase by your child/ward
will be the&nbsp;Enhanced Device Bundle&nbsp;comprising the following :&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Apple iPad [10.2” 9th Gen model, A13 Bionic chip, 64 GB Storage]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple Pencil&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruggedized Keyboard Combo 3 Case&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 Year AppleCare+</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 Year Insurance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The price of the Enhanced Device Bundle is tentatively priced at $865.40
and is inclusive of 9% GST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Enhanced Device Bundle includes the device, associated accessories,
insurance, warranty, and fortnightly courier service by Contractor to collect
damaged devices from school&nbsp;<em>(Or parents can choose to send directly to the 6 Apple Service Centres)</em>
</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Use of Edusave.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully
or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous
fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. MOE has
provided additional Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in
2023 to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools.
This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary
school students and $230 for primary school students.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <strong>Financial Assistance.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining sums
due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table
below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:</p>

<p><strong>Software Applications</strong>
</p>
<p>6. <strong>IT Applications.</strong>
</p>
<p>Schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital
for students’ teaching and learning through this programme. These include:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Student iCON (Google Workspace)</strong>:
Every secondary school student will be provided with access to the Google
Suite set of tools, including email address.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Microsoft 365 Pro Plus</strong>: Every secondary
school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.</p>
<p>The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s full name, Student iCON
ID and class to set up user accounts. The school may also choose to roll
out applications other than those listed above.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Device Management Application. ("DMA"). </strong>A <strong>DMA</strong> will
be pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school and will need
to be installed on devices that parents/guardians have opted for the student
to use in lieu of the PLD purchased through the school, after parents/guardians
have given consent. The DMA has 3 main components which will support the
effective use of the PLD in the classroom to enhance students’ learning
and safeguard their cyber wellness:
<br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Classroom Management Service</u>. To help teachers
manage students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom
management and support effective teaching and learning.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Mobile Device Management Service</u>. To help
update and manage the PLD, protect the PLD from malicious software, and
protects students from objectionable internet content.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Usage Management Service</u>. To enable
school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits
for students’ use of PLD after school.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Cyber-wellness.</strong>Parents/Guardians may have concerns
regarding students’ cyber wellness with the introduction of the PLD. The
DMA allows the school to manage this by:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collecting data on usage by the
student, such as the websites accessed on the PLD,</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitoring, filtering, and limiting
the type of websites accessible to the student, and placing restrictions
on students’ screen time to prevent cyber addiction.</p>
<p>Please refer to <u>Annexes A, B and C</u> for more details on the functions
and features of the DMA, and on the collection and protection of personal
data.</p>
<ol start="9" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Devices not purchased through the school.</strong> If parents/guardians
choose not to purchase the school-prescribed PLD bundle (see para 3) and
prefer that their child/ward use their own computing device (“non-prescribed
device”) in school, that device must have the same Operating System (OS)
as the school-prescribed PLD. The school will verify that the device has
the same OS as the school-prescribed PLD and is compatible with the DMA
before approving it as an alternative to the school-prescribed PLD. Parents
will be required to consent to the installation of the DMA, and the DMA
must be installed in the non-prescribed device, before it can be used in
school in lieu of the school-prescribed PLD.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purchase of PLD.</strong> To proceed with the purchase of the school-prescribed
PLD, please consent for the purchase via the Parents Gateway (PG) notification.
Parents who want to use Edusave funds for the PLD (for Singapore citizens
students only), please submit the online Standing Order (SO) from via this
link: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/edusaveformsgso</a> by <strong>31 Dec 2024</strong> if
you have not done so previously. If you are unable to submit the online
form, please approach the school for assistance or to request for a hardcopy
form.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upcoming activities.</strong> Billing and payment for the PLD will

<p>[4] Parents may request corrections to their personal data (e.g. email
addresses, names) by contacting the school, in accordance with the PDPA.</p>
<p>[5] Only parents/guardians who chose Option A for the After-School DMA
Parent Option will have access of their child’s/ ward’s information i.e.
student’s name and email address, and the applications installed on the
PLD.</p>
<p>[6] Only aggregated web browsing history can be retrieved which does not
reference to specific user.</p>
<p>[7]Teachers will not have access to the application error data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. To prevent unauthorised access, DMA Administrators and the DMA Vendor
will be required to access their accounts using 2-factor authentication
or the equivalent to ensure proper accountability for information access
and other activities performed. There will be regular account reviews and
audits for DMA Administrators’ and the DMA Vendor’s accounts.</p>
<p>4. All user data collected through the DMA (see paragraph 2 of Annex B)
will be stored in secure servers managed by an appointed DMA Vendor with
stringent access controls and audit trail implemented. The DMA is a trusted
cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that has been operating
for many years. The DMA has also been subjected to regular security review
and assessment by independent reviewers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. MOE has assessed and concluded that the DMA solution has sufficient
security robustness to ensure data collected are properly stored and protected.
MOE will also subject the DMA Vendor to regular audit on the security of
the system based on tender requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Data collected and managed by the IT Applications</strong>
</p>
<p>6. <strong>IT Applications</strong>. For the IT Applications (Student iCON
and Microsoft 365 Pro Plus), the school will use your child’s/ward’s personal
data such as his/her full name, birth certificate number and class to set
up user accounts. This data will also be used for the purposes of authenticating
and verifying user identity, troubleshooting and facilitating system improvements.
In addition, the commercial providers of these platforms (e.g., Google,
Microsoft) will collect and deal with user data generated by your child’s/ward’s
use of these applications. The collection, use and disclosure of such data
are governed by the commercial provider’s terms of use, which can be found
here:</p>

<p>7. All user data which is collected by MOE will be stored in secure servers
managed by the respective vendors of our systems. The Government has put
in place strong personal data protection laws and policies to safeguard
sensitive data collected by public agencies such as MOE. Please refer to
