<h1>De-enrolment of PLD from DMA</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MOE DMA will be uninstalled from your child’s/ward’s iPadOS PLD on <strong>17 Nov 2025. </strong>You
may refer to the <a href="/files/DMA/2025_PLD_De_Enrolment_for_Grad_Classes.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">briefing slides</a> shared
previously.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Actions required by graduating students:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Before the MOE DMA uninstallation (Date stated above):</strong> Please
ensure that all data on the PLD and school cloud storage is backed up (e.g.
saved on personal external and/or cloud storage) at least one day before
the MOE DMA uninstallation. Data not backed up will not be retrievable
in the event of data loss during the factory reset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A day after the MOE DMA uninstallation (Factory reset):</strong> Please
ensure that the PLD is switched on and connected to the Internet for the
entire day. This is to ensure PLD receives the factory reset command to
completely remove the MOE DMA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Connects their PLD to a power outlet, or ensure
it has at least 50% battery charge, to prevent any issues during the factory
reset process.</p>
