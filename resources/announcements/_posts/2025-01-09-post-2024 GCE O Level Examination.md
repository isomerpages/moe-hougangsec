<p>Dear students</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results of the 2024 GCE O-Level examination will be released on Friday,
10 January 2025 at 2.30 pm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arrangements have been made for you to receive your results in the school
hall. Parents and guardians may accompany you to school to collect your
results. They will be able to witness the release of results in the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Candidates who are unable to collect their results in person can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. If
your family member is collecting your results on your behalf, it can only
be done between 4 pm and 5 pm. He / She will need to bring the School Letter
of Authorisation. This letter can be downloaded <u>here</u>. Your family
member will need to bring along their Photo ID for verification by the
GO.</p>

<p>All the best to all of you!</p>
