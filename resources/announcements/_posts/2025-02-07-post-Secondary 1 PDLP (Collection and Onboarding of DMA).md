<p>The school has arranged for your child to collect the Personal Learning
Device (PLD) in school <strong>on 20<sup>th</sup> Feb</strong>, <strong>8.45 am</strong>.
<br>Since it is a HBL day, the school work received by your child will be
adjusted accordingly.
<br>
<br>Your child will be collecting the following:</p>
<p>- Model: Apple iPad 10.9 10th Gen, 64GB Storage (GB),
<br><strong>Add-on/Accessories Item(s):</strong>
<br>- Apple Pencil (USB-C), and
<br>- Logitech Ruggedized Combo 4
<br>The purchase includes a 3-Year carry-in warranty and 3-Year insurance.
<br>
<br>During the session, the school will need to use your child’s/ward’s full
name, Student iCON ID and class to set up user accounts. Your child will
also be <strong>provided with a School Managed Apple ID</strong> (e.g.
<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">peter_jones_lim@appleid.hougangsec.moe.edu.sg</a>). This provides your
child 200 GB of iCloud storage so that they can easily sync and backup
their learning materials throughout their secondary school years.
<br>
<br><strong>Please note:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A Device Management Application (DMA) will be installed on all PLDs purchased
through the school, as well as devices that parents/guardians have opted
for the student to use in lieu of the PLD purchased through the school.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a refresher, the DMA has 3 main components which will support the effective
use of the PLD in the classroom to enhance students' learning and safeguard
their cyber wellness:</p>
<p>(a) Classroom Management Service. To help teachers manage students’ use
of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support
effective teaching and learning.
<br>(b) Mobile Device Management Service. To help update and manage the PLD,
protect the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable
internet content.
<br>(c) Usage Management Service. To enable school and/or parents/guardians
to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after
school.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents/guardians may have concerns regarding students’ cyber wellness
with the introduction of the PLD. The DMA allows the school to manage this
by:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;collecting data on usage by the student, such as the websites
accessed on the PLD,
<br>(b) monitoring, filtering, and limiting the type of websites accessible
to the student, and
<br>(c) placing restrictions on students’ screen time to prevent cyber addiction.</p>
