<p>Dear students</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results of the <strong>2025 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) examination</strong> will
be released on <strong>14 January 2026</strong> at <strong>2.00pm</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arrangements have been made for you to receive your results in the school
hall. Parents and guardians may accompany you to school to collect your
results. They will be able to witness the release of results in the hall.</p>
<p>Also, please note the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Report to the hall <u>by 1.45 pm</u>. Please be punctual and in your school
attire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the hall, report directly to your class. Signages will be placed to
direct you to your class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are expected to adhere to HS grooming requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event you do not meet the grooming requirements, you will not be
allowed to enter the school and will be asked to return to HS at 4.00 pm
instead, to collect your results from the General Office.</p>
<p>Candidates who are unable to collect their results in person can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. If
your family member is collecting your results on your behalf, it can only
be done between 4 pm and 5 pm. He / She will need to bring the School Letter
of Authorisation. This letter is given <strong><a href="/files/Letter_of_Authorisation.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a></strong>.
Your family member will need to bring along their Photo ID for verification
by the GO.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, do raise them with your Character Coaches.</p>
<p>All the best to all of you!</p>
